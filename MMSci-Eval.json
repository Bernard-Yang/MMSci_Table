    "description": "We show the advantages of projecting the output state of node u to the local coordinate system of node v when computing the message m(k) u→v in the ablation study in Table III.. However, we conduct ablation studies for our model at 95% recall in the next sections, which is closer to the demand that self-driving cars should meet.. Ablation Study: We first study the per-actor feature extraction mechanism of our model by comparing simple feature indexing versus Rotated RoI Align. We do this study in a model that does not contemplate interactions for better isolation. In particular, we omit our SPAGNN from Fig. 2 and use the initial trajectories predicted by CNNR as the final output. As shown in the first 2 rows of Table III, Rotated RoI Align clearly outperforms simple feature indexing. Our RRoI pooled features provide better information about the surroundings of the target vehicle since they contain features in a region spanning by 25 meters whereas the feature indexing variant consists of just accessing the feature map at the anchor location associated to the detection.. e) Graph Neural Network architectures: We evaluate several GNN architectures with different levels of spatial. awareness to demonstrate the effectiveness of our SPAGNN.. The second to third rows of Table III show that adding a standard GNN without spatial awareness does not improve performance. From the third to the forth row we observe an improvement by including the detection bounding boxes in global (G) coordinate frame as part of the state at every message passing iteration of the GNN. Then, we make these bounding boxes relative (R) to the actor receiving the message, which gives us a boost across most metrics. Finally, we add the parameters of the predicted probability distributions of the future trajectories to the message passing algorithm to recover our SPAGNN. Interestingly, the models become more certain, i.e. lower entropy (H), as we add better spatial-awareness mechanisms."

The two images, one for the method of  and one for our method, were presented in a random order.

The intra-domain difference between classes is higher in mini-ImageNet than in CUB (Chen et al. ), which is reflected by a drop of the test accuracies of all methods. It can also be seen that when the domain difference between the training and test stage classes increases (left to right in Figure 3) the performance of all few-shot algorithms lowers.. As expected, the classification accuracy lowers slightly when going from the mini-ImageNet → CUB to the CUB → mini-ImageNet setting. Interestingly though, it does not decrease substantially. This shows that the different feature embeddings generalize well, at least across these two different datasets.

In this table we also clearly see the advantage of using spatiotemporal features.. Since we are using a two-stream network, we get two separate predictions for a video. The results are combined and the average is taken as the final prediction. These scores are represented by the last column in the table.. Our proposed method, SummaryNet is shown in the last row of Table 2.. In Table 2, we see that I3D-based features serve as a better, more rich representation of the videos than ResNet features. This is evident from the respective accuracies of both approaches–with the baseline I3D approach achieving an accuracy of 68.64%, compared to the 50.48% from the ResNet baseline approach.. This large difference can be attributed to the fact that the ResNet features only incorporate 2D spatial information into the representation, whereas the I3D features incorporate 3D spatial information (through the RGB stream), as well as explicitly modelling temporal information (through the optical flow stream). This shows that separately modelling spatial / appearance and temporal / motion information in videos is useful.. We use a simple averaging approach whereby the RGB and optical flow outputs of the sigmoid regression network are simply averaged. This simple scheme is likely a suboptimal way to fuse the information from the two streams and more complex information fusion methods can likely yield higher performance. The ConvLSTM I3D model improves upon the previous, standard ConvNet model on all metrics (RGB, optical flow, and combined).. We attribute this performance increase to the encoder-decoder model, which is able to effectively capture the most salient information from the I3D representations, and remove any noise from the core signal that could potentially be detrimental in the sigmoid network's learning process.. Thus, the change points supplied by using the I3D features clearly demonstrate its superiority over using simple 2D spatial features, such as those from ResNet."

This means the baseline classifier is less accurate and has poor ability to detect its own inaccuracy on novel samples — it does not know what it does not know. For example, in gender recognition, the label error increases from 2.8% for novel to 14.7%; the calibration error ECE increases from 0.013 to 0.109; and the NLL increases from 0.083 to 0.542..

However, our Recall@1 on SOP is 77.3%, which is only 0.9% lower than 78.2% of (Wang et al., 2019c). It is also worth mentioning that among these approaches, except fine-tuned models with CCE, only our method has a clear probability interpretation and aims to maximise the joint instance-level matching probability.

Compared with Singlepath-Oneshot, HURRICANE (Stage1 + Stage2) reduces 30.4% supernet training time and finds models with better performance. Furthermore, HURRICANE (Stage1) already achieves better classification accuracy than other NAS methods (loss ≤ 0.5% compared with our final result) but it could reduce an average 54.7% time, which is almost a 2X training time speedup.

(2) Temporal Ensembling semi-supervised learning as outlined in , applied in a transfer learning setting. Temporal Ensembling is applied in the post-transfer training stage. (3) Mk-MMD , which is based on 19 different Gaussian kernels with different standard deviations. Mk-MMD is applied in the pre-transfer training stage. (4) Lautum regularization our technique as described in Section IV. (5) Both Temporal Ensembling and Lautum regularization. Note that Temporal Ensembling is applied in the post-transfer training stage, whereas Lautum regularization is applied in the pre-transfer training stage.. For each of the five transfer learning methods we examined three different splits of the notMNIST training dataset which consists of 200,000 samples to an unlabeled part and a labeled part: (1) unlabeled part of 199,950 samples and a labeled part of 50 samples; (2) unlabeled part of 199,900 samples and a labeled part of 100 samples; (3) unlabeled part of 199,800 samples and a labeled part of 200 samples.. Using the settings outlined above we obtained the results shown in Table. for the MNIST → notMNIST case.. The advantage of using Lautum regularization is evident from the results, as it outperforms the other compared methods in all the examined target training set splits.. In general, the Temporal Ensembling method by itself does not yield very competitive results compared to standard transfer learning. However, the combination of Lautum regularization and Temporal Ensembling provides the best target test set accuracy over all the examined target training set splits."

Besides, although its collision is not the smallest, ACML manages to achieve relatively smaller collisions (i.e., 1.9, 1.7 and 7.2 for three scenarios), since avoiding collision is also in favor of the total reward.. For traffic control, ACML outperforms CommNet and AMP as shown by the upper part of Table 1. The reason is that ACML has found better tradeoffs between small delay and small collision.. Both ACML-mean and ACML-attention improve ACML by a clear margin, and they perform much better than CommNet and AMP as shown in Table 1.. For traffic control scenarios, as shown at the lower part of Table 1, Gated-ACML emits much fewer messages than ACML, which is expected. What surprises us is that GatedACML even obtains more rewards than ACML.. Consequently, the delay of ACML is larger than that of Gated-ACML as shown in Table 1.. We also modify ATOC to make it suitable for continuous action and heterogeneous agents. The results are shown at the last row of Table 1 and 2. ATOC works well in traffic control tasks, but performs badly in routing and wifi tasks."

For the dense network MIT, HSRL(DW), HSRL(N2V), and HSRL(LINE) outperform the baselines by 2.9%, 8.5%, and 0.5%. For three large networks, DBLP, Yelp, and Douban, the improvement of HSRL is striking: the improvements of HSRL(DW), HSRL(N2V), and HSRL(LINE) are 6.3%, 19.9%, 3.5% for DBLP, 6.5%, 16.8%, 5.9% for Yelp, and 18.4%, 30.5%, 17.5% for Douban.. The results of HARP on movielens, DBLP, Yelp, and Douban are worse than the original NRL methods. Moreover, the performance of HARP(LINE) is drastically worse than LINE. It only works better than DeepWalk, node2vec on MIT which is a small and dense network.. The compressed networks generated by HARP on a network could not reveal its global topologies. Hence, using node embeddings of compressed networks as initialization could mislead the NRL methods to a bad local minimum. Such an issue could occur especially when the input network is large-scale and the objective function of the NRL method is highly non-convex, e.g., LINE.. The improvements of HSRL on DBLP, Yelp, and Duban are larger than that on Movielens and MIT. It demonstrates that HSRL works much better than baselines on large-scale networks."

For the sagittal push, two impulses are chosen such that foot stepping occurs for the larger impulse (1.73N s/kg), while the smaller impulse (0.57N s/kg) will result in a strategy without stepping. By comparing the rejectable normalized impulse of the strategies not taking a step (A, B, E, G), it can be seen that our policy performs similar (E: 0.57N s/kg, G: 0.56N s/kg) to the other controllers (A: 0.6N s/kg, B: 0.52N s/kg). For the strategies taking a step (C, D, F), our policy is able to perform better (F: 1.73N s/kg) than the stepping controllers. (0.52N s/kg) and D (0.6N s/kg).

CSI achieves better performance than SLI and fPCA, regardless of the treatment effect µ and observation rate ρ. Meanwhile SLI performs better than fPCA. 2. All three methods give comparable errors for smaller values of µ. In particular, our introduc tion of treatment effect µ does not over-fit the model in the case of µ = 0. 3. As the treatment effect µ increases, the performance of CSI remains the same whereas the performances of SLI and fPCA deteriorate rapidly. As a result, CSI outperforms SLI and fPCA by a significant margin for large values of µ. For example, when ρ = 0.1, the MSE( ˆY ) of CSI decreases from 72.3% of SLI and 59.6% of fPCA at µ = 1 to 12.4% of SLI and 5.8% of fPCA at µ = 5. 4. All three algorithms suffer a higher MSE( ˆY ) with smaller observation rate ρ. The biggest decay comes from SLI with an average 118% increase in test error from ρ = 0.5 to ρ = 0.1. The performances of fPCA and CSI remains comparatively stable among different observation rate with a 6% and 12% increase respectively. This implies that our algorithm is tolerant to low observation rate."

We next measure performance on the KNN identification task. The bottom half of Table 1 reports the results. In the KNN experiment, each clean image is identified by comparing to the test gallery which is either comprised of clean or corrupted images based on its K = 5 nearest neighbors. The identification is considered correct only if a majority of the neighbors have the correct class. Again, the proposed stochastic embeddings generally outperform point embeddings, with the greatest advantage for the corrupted input samples.

    "description": "The average precision (AP) of this task is reported in the top half of Table 1. HIB shows improved performance, especially for corrupted test images. For example, in the. = 2 digit case, when using D = 2 dimensions, point embeddings achieve 88.0% AP on corrupt test images, while hedged instance embeddings improves to 90.7% with. = 1 Gaussian, and 91.2% with. = 2 Gaussians. We next measure performance on the KNN identification task. The bottom half of Table 1 reports the results. In the KNN experiment, each clean image is identified by comparing to the test gallery which is either comprised of clean or corrupted images based on its K = 5 nearest neighbors. The identification is considered correct only if a majority of the neighbors have the correct class. Again, the proposed stochastic embeddings generally outperform point embeddings, with the greatest advantage for the corrupted input samples. For example, in the. = 2 digit case, when using D = 2 dimensions, point embeddings achieve 58.3% AP on corrupt test images, while HIB improves to 76.0% with. = 1 Gaussian, and 75.7% with. = 2 Gaussians."

Calculated over two sets of starting values and parameters for the Lorenz map, the Conditional WaveNet produces and average ranging between 0.004 and 0.007. The LSTM architecture ranges around 0.0063. The gains in speed versus full gradient descent are at least ten fold. Even if the time series are of short history, there are gains to using a stochastic gradient descent optimization routine. In Table 2 several itemized results means and standard deviations are reported.. The suspicion that rigorous tuning can lead to significant improvement is the 10 fold improvement in x prediction RMSE over best benchmark achieved uniformly over all runs with the conditional WaveNet and different Lorenz data distributions (different σ, r and b parameters)."

    "reasoning": "FMNet with spatial feature fusion achieves the best accuracy and lowest latency among the compared CNN architectures, while also having the lowest FLOPS, number of parameters, and MAC.",
    "description": "First, we compared the prediction accuracy and inference latency on several base CNN architectures. We found that the proposed FMNet gives similar prediction accuracy as other modern architectures such as ResNet, MNv2, and MnasNet, while being much faster during inference. In terms of the number of FLOPS and parameters, FMNet is similar to MnasNet-0.5 and MNv2-0.5 (which it is based on), while AlexNet and ResNet18 have many more FLOPS and parameters. Fast inference of FMNet can be explained by low MAC and operation counts, which we specifically optimized for during the model design phase. It is interesting to note that AlexNet is the second fastest CNN while having the second largest FLOPS. This is possibly due to it having the smallest number of layers, as evidenced by its lowest operation counts, although its accuracy is not on par with the competing networks.. In the first set of experiments we compared a number of CNN architectures, summarizing results in Table II. To ensure fair comparison and avoid potential issues with small data sets, we trained all models on vehicle actors where we set the prediction horizon to 6s. Average prediction error and latency are reported in the table. We skip the feature fusion layers when computing the number of parameters, as the concatenation feature fusion adds a large amount of parameters which complicates the comparison (an 1024 × 4096 fully-connected layer for feature fusion adds 4M extra parameters). MAC is approximated by the sum of tensor sizes of all graph nodes. Column \"Num. ops\" refers to the total number of operations in the TensorFlow graph of each model. The inference latency is measured at a batch of 32 actors on a GTX 1080Ti GPU.. For simplicity and to facilitate fair comparison, we implemented all models using TensorFlow built-in operations without additional optimization.. Secondly, we found that FMNet with spatial feature fusion further improves the accuracy and inference time when compared to the model with feature fusion through concatenation.. This resulted in lower FLOPS, as well as lower number of parameters and MAC. Following these results we use the best performing FMNet with spatial fusion as the model architecture in the following ablation studies on rasterization choices."

    "description": "We conducted ablation study regarding the rasterization setup, modifying various parameters of the rasterization configuration of the base setup. Empirical results in terms of average prediction error, as well as short- and long-term errors are given in Table III. We can see that the all variants of the proposed CNN approach (referred to as RasterNet) significantly outperform UKF, especially at longer horizons.. As can be seen, for pedestrians 0.1m-resolution indeed resulted in lower error, while setting 0.3m gave the worst performance. We observed that resolution of 0.1m showed no significant difference for bicyclists, while 0.3m resulted in slightly higher error.. Next, we evaluated the impact of not rotating raster such that actor heading points up, as discussed in Section III-B,. which resulted in a significant drop of accuracy for both actor types.. We observed error increase without traffic light rasterization for both actor types, matching this intuition.. Furthermore, we removed lane heading information provided in raster images, encoded by using different colors to indicate different directions. Without lane heading bicyclist model degraded slightly in performance, while pedestrian model was unaffected.. Finally, we tried learning raster colors instead of setting them manually. The results indicate that learned colors slightly improved accuracy for bicyclists, whereas the pedestrian model slightly degraded compared to the baseline.. Lastly, due to significantly larger amount of vehicle data as compared to VRUs, instead of training from scratch we finetuned VRU models using preloaded weights from a pretrained vehicle model. As observed in the second-to-last row, directly applying the vehicle model to bicyclists and pedestrians without fine-tuning results in poor performance across the board, even worse than UKF, due to a different nature of these actor types as compared to vehicles. On the other hand, with additional fine-tuning using training data of corresponding actor types the bicyclist performance improved over the baseline, indicating that bicyclists may exhibit similar behavior to vehicles. We can also see that the pedestrian model regressed, explained by the fact that pedestrian motion is very different from vehicle motion, thus making vehicle pretraining ineffective."

Note that the loss gradient cannot be calculated at test time since we do not have labels available — instead, we calculate a separate extrapolation score using the gradient for the loss with respect to each possible label, and take the minimum. Our method achieves the best performance on most settings, and is competitive with the best baseline on each. However, the variation between the tasks is quite noteworthy. We note two patterns in particular. Firstly, we note that the performance of MaxProb and the loss gradient variant of our method are quite correlated, and we hypothesize this correlation is related to ∇ ˆY (cid:96). Additionally, observe the effect of increasing m is inconsistent between experiments:"

As depicted in (Table II), we notice that recall descends with the data-set unlike precision. This is because the classification performed by the model is a pixel-wise classification of occluded images, which is of very high order per image and the reason the saturated recall value for the available dataset is 0.4042 which is not the best for the available dataset due to surplus hardware."

Similarly, certain distinctive test data-sets have been evaluated over different hyper-parameters to obtain the over-all accuracy of the model and the results had been tabulated in Table.I. We observed a significant improvement in the results in comparison to the existing methods like SVM, MLPC, as shown in Fig.6 and a few other adaptive algorithms, as in , .. To start with, we used smaller data-set of 100 images tested on the model trained with 300 images (Table I), on a system with specifications of I7 processor, 8GB RAM and 4GB Nvidia G-force GPU. But, the time-complexity hasn't reduced when compared to the previous models. Hence, the model has been implemented on a 8-core cluster based online (cloud) GPU with low time-complexity. As tabulated in [Table I], effective training with larger data-sets and better efficiency ( 97%) is made possible with CNN's. The images obtained through a set of Google APIs, near the surroundings of our institute (Fig.7) have been tested with the correlation coefficient approximated to value 1."

We. concatenated old traditional features with new entropy-domain features which were statistically significant (p-value < 0.05). There were 41 and 101 new entropy-domain features for arousal and valence respectively. The result shows that the Entropy-assisted model (III) we propose has the best performance in most of the situations. For single modality, all three of them in valence raise the F1score by over or around 10%. Huge improvements compared to previous methods (Scheme I), +12.1% and +25.3% for arousal and valence respectively, are found in Fusion modalities. +17.8% can be found in EEG for valence between Scheme II and Scheme III."

We decrease the bias of the target class by τ0 to obtain a model that is still verifiably robust but easier to be attacked. Since modifying the bias would affect test accuracy, we also evaluate the minimal test accuracy of modified models of the successful attacks for each implementation.

In each test, 300 samples are drawn from uniform distribution X ∼. (−1, 1). The function f (.) is nonlinear and ε is generated from different non-Gaussian distributions.

Comparison between methods is shown in Table 1 for different performance measures of Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between predictions and responses, and Integral Squared Error (ISE) between estimated function and f (x)..

However, more parameters need to be selected: the velocity and a shut-off parameter. • For the bypass of the position, the UAV is less controllable and the guidance is slower (outer part of the controller), but it is less complex since only one parameter needs to be controlled and then the autopilot does the rest..

For the Carl and UND-X1 datasets, state-of-the-art models are Deep Perceptual Mapping  and Hu et al. . On EURECOM dataset, only  presented a study for the thermal to visible recognition. The authors propose an image synthesis method by using cascaded refinement network. However, their benchmark setup is different to visible face recognition studies. than ours and earlier thermal. The highest accuracies are reached when preprocessing, up convolution, and alignment are used. As can be seen in Table I, the proposed method is superior to the DPM, when two visible images per subject and all available visible images per subject are used in the gallery.. From Table I, it can also be observed that alignment improves the performance by around 2%.. Up convolution is found to be more useful compared to upsampling leading to increased accuracies on all there datasets. Similarly, applying preprocessing has enhanced the performance further on all three datasets, which indicates its importance."

By contrast, our method doesn't need adversarial example. Final results are shown in Table. 1 and 2.. generation and can achieves comparable robustness under (cid:96)∞ = 3 constraints. We test the average time of each epoch for both natural training and gradient regularized training. Our time consumption is average 2.1 times than natural training per epoch. Notice that the robustness enhancement of our method becomes lower when (cid:96)∞ becomes larger. This shows one limitation of gradient regularization methods: Our gradient regularization approach is based on Taylor approximation in a small neighborhood. When the adversarial examples exceeds the reasonable approximating range, the gradient regularization effect also exhausts."

    "description": "The ablation results are presented in Table 1, 2 showing progressive improvements, which justify the added complexity.. From Table 1, it is clear that TGIF-QA is highly linguistically. biased while the problem is mitigated with SVQA dataset to some extent.. Ling.+S.Frame: This is a very basic model of VQA that combines the encoded question vector with CNN features of a random frame from a given video. As expected, this baseline gives modest improvements over the model using only linguistic features. S.Frame+MAC: To demonstrate the significance of multi-step reasoning in Video QA, we randomly select one video frame and then use its CNN feature maps as the knowledge base of the multi-step centralized reasoning module MAC. In other words, this experiment reflects the importance of multi-step reasoning in a question answering problem. As SVQA dataset contains questions with compositional sequences, it greatly benefits from the multi-step centralized reasoning module. Avg.Pool+MAC: A baseline to assess the significance of temporal information in the simplest form of average temporal pooling comparing to ones with a single frame. We follow  to sparely sample 8 frames which are the middle frames of the equal size segments from a given video. As can be seen, this model is able to achieve significant improvements in both SVQA and TGIF-QA. Due to the linguistic bias, the contribution of visual information to the overall performance on TGIF-QA is much less than that of SVQA. TRN+MAC: This baseline is a special case of ours where we flatten the hierarchy, and the relation network is applied at the frame level, similar to what proposed in . The model mitigates the limit of feature engineering process of using only one single frame for video representation as well as simply temporal pooling over the whole sequence of frames. Apparently, using a single frame loses crucial temporal information of the video and is likely to fail when strong temporal reasoning is needed, particularly in state transition and counting. We use visual features processed in the Avg.Pool+MAC experiment to input into a TRN module for fair comparisons. TRN improves by more than 12% of overall performance from one with a single video frame, while that of state transition task on TGIF-QA is more than 2%, around 1.5% for both repeating action and frame QA and 0.08 MSE in case of repetition count. Although this baseline produces great increments on SVQA comparing to the experiment Avg.Pool+MAC, it barely outperforms those on TGIF-QA. CRN+MLP: In order to evaluate how the reasoning module affects the overall performance, we conduct this experiment by using a feed-forward network as the reasoning module with the proposed visual representation CRN. CRN+MAC: This is our proposed method in which we opt CRN as the knowledge base of the compositional attention module. We experience significant improvements on all tasks over the simplistic TRN on SVQA whilst that of. TGIF-QA dataset is more moderate. The results reveal the strong CRN's capability as well as a better suit of video representation for reasoning over the simplistic TRN, especially in case of compositional reasoning. The results are also consistent with our earlier arguments that sparsely sampled frames from the video are insufficient to embrace fast-pace actions/events such as repeating action and repetition count."

    "description": "Table 4 (TGIF-QA, real).. For the TGIF-QA dataset, Jang et al.  extended winner models of the VQA 2016 challenge to evaluate on Video QA task, namely VIS+LSTM  and VQA-MCB . Early fusion and late fusion are applied to both two approaches. We also list some other methods provided by  including those proposed by  and . Interestingly, none of the previous work reported ablation study of utilizing only textual cues as the input of the system to assess the linguistic bias of the dataset, and the fact that some of the reported methods produced worse performance than this baseline. We suspect that improper integrating of visual information caused confusion to the system giving such low performance. In  , Jang et al. also proposed their own methods of leveraging spatial and temporal attention. In Table 4, SP indicates spatial attention, ST presents temporal attention while \"R\" and \"C\" mean ResNet features and C3D features, respectively. Later, Gao et al.  greatly advanced the performance on this dataset with a co-memory mechanism on two video feature streams. Li et al.  recently set the state of the art performance on TGIF-QA with only ResNet features by using a novel self-attention mechanism. Our method, similarly in the sense that we only use ResNet features, is able to achieve significant improvements on three tasks including repeating action, state transition and frame QA while we are slightly advanced on repetition count task compared to our competitor  using the same video features.. Specifically, we gain better performance than  of around 1% for repeating action, approximately 2% for state transition, 3.5% for frame QA, and 0.04 MSE for repetition count.. For repetition counting in TGIF-QA, although we have not outperformed , it is not directly comparable since they utilized motion in addition to appearance, whilst in our case motion is not explicitly used and thus the action boundaries are not clearly detected. We hypothesize that counting task needs a specific network, as evident in recent work [21, 33]."

Table 3 summarizes the results after 100 million frames.. CTS and DQNMMC e We can clearly see that our algorithm achieves scores much higher than those achieved by DQN, which struggles in games that pose hard exploration problems. When comparing our algorithm to DQNMMC PIXELCNN we observe that, on average, DQNMMC +SR at least matches the performance of these algorithms while being simpler by not requiring a density model. Instead, our algorithm requires the SR, which is domain-independent as it is already defined for every problem since it is a component of the value function estimates, as discussed in Section 2. Finally, DQNMMC +SR also outperforms RND (Burda et al. 2019) when it is trained for 100 million frames.4 e. e the comparison between DQNMMC +SR and Finally, DQNMMC shows that the provided exploration bonus has a big impact in the game MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE, which is probably known as the hardest game among those we used in our evaluation, and the only game where agents do not learn how to achieve scores greater than zero with random e. exploration. Interestingly, the change in architecture and the use of MMC leads to a big improvement in games such as GRAVITAR and VENTURE, which we cannot fully explain. However, because the change in architecture does not have any effect in MONTEZUMA'S REVENGE, it seems that the proposed exploration bonus is essential in games with very sparse rewards.. While the results depicted in Table 3 allow us to see the benefit of using an exploration bonus derived from the SR, they do not inform us about the impact of the auxiliary task in the results.. the comparisons in Table 3 and the results in this section suggest that the exploration bonus we introduced is essential for our approach to achieve state-of-the-art performance."

The same tests are conducted on feature squeezing (FS) . The best result achieved by FS is 77%. FS especially does not preform well on FGSM and BIM, which is consistent with the observation of Xu et al. .. The false positive rate (the FP column in Table 3) is 9.91% for AmI and 23.32% for FS on the VF dataset.. we conducted a few additional experiments: (1) we use only attribute substitution to extract witnesses and then build the attribute-steered model for detection with results shown in the AS row of Table 3; (2) we use only attribute preservation (AP); (3) we only weaken non-witnesses (WKN); and (4) we only strengthen witnesses (STN). Our results show that although AS or AP alone can detect adversarial samples with good accuracy, their false positive rates (see the FP column) are very high (i.e., 20.41% and 30.61%).. Specifically, we evaluate on four subsets of attribute witnesses extracted using bi-directional reasoning as shown in Table 3: (1) we exclude witnesses of left eye (w/o Left Eye); (2) exclude witnesses of right eye (w/o Right Eye); (3) exclude witnesses of nose (w/o Nose); and (4) exclude witnesses of mouth (w/o Mouth). We observe that the detection accuracy degrades a bit (less than 5% in most cases)."

An accumulated reward of +1 would be given before a terminated environment (e.g., falling 15 degrees from vertical, or a cart shifting more than 2.4 units from the center). As experimental settings, we select a sample size of 1000, and use relu activation for neural network output to select an adaptive action in Tab. II. To solve the problem, we conduct and fine-tune both NEAT and FS-NEAT as baseline results for accessing targeted accumulated rewards of 195.0 in 200 episode steps ..

    "reasoning": "Our method achieves comparable performances with baselines on simple tasks and outperforms them on difficult tasks, converging faster and obtaining better final results.",
    "description": "In comparative evaluations, we carry out several RLfD baselines, including Pre-train (Silver et al. 2016) and POfD (Kang, Jie, and Feng 2018). In particular, we introduce another two baselines of penalty method3 with MMD as discrepancy measure, denoted by Penalty and Penalty + Ann., and the later one also employ an annealing strategy described in Sec. 4. We also run two non-RLfD baselines PPO and MMD-Imitation (denoted as MMD-IL) to verify the reward sparsification and the imperfect expert setting respectively. PPO will run with the sparse reward while MMD-IL will directly optimize the objective defined in (9) with provided imperfect demonstrations.. The results of our compar. ative evaluations are summarized in Table 1, which averaged 50 trials under the learned policies.. The results overall read that our method achieves comparable performances with the baselines on relatively simple tasks (such as MountainCar) and outperforms them with a large margin on difficult tasks (such as Hopper, Walker2d and Ant). During policy optimization, our method can converge faster than other RLfD counterparts as well as obtains better final results. Comparing with the strong baseline of Pre-train, we can see that although convergence efficiency of proposed method during the early phase of training may not have significant advantages, but as it continues, the performance of our method can be improved persistently like Hopper(+973.42) and Walker2d(+876.40), while Pre-train struggles on achieving higher return, which demonstrates that our method could benefit more from the exploration guidance offered by the soft constraint during the whole policy optimization procedure than by only imitating at the beginning.. On the other hand, we also find that our algorithm exhibits a more stable and efficient behavior over all the baselines using the penalty method. From the learning curve and numerical results, it can be seen that adopting penalty with imperfect demonstrations will induce a noisy and misleading gradient update, which will prevent the performances from improving further while our method with a soft constraint will not suffer from this. This essentially accounts for the performance gap between our method and all baselines with penalty departures. Moreover, the complex training strategies and auxiliary model in POfD also leads to unstable and. inefficient training across different tasks and environment specifications.. From the results of PPO and MMD-Imitation, the experiment settings of reward sparsification and imperfect demonstrations can be verified. As it illustrates, under sparse environmental feedback, pure PPO fails to find an optimal policy on most of the tested tasks, which indicates the impact of ineffective exploration. While with few imperfect demonstrations, MMD-Imitation also cannot learn promising policies. It suggests that combining the demonstrations and environmental feedback would be essential for the designated tasks. Furthermore, as similar MMD-Imitation update may happen in our method when the optimization just starts (mentioned in Sec. 3.3), these results also show how can our method benefit from the follow-up solving of the constrained optimization problem."

In our experiments, we observed that having UNet encourages the network to find more local correspondences. Without UNet, the network failed to preserve correspondence between semantic parts and there were common error patterns such as the face direction becoming mirrored after translation – which is technically allowed by all our loss terms but is judged as being unnatural by human. Note that similar error patterns are observed in our experiment with MUNIT 1, which does not use UNet. Adding cycle loss and semantic consistency loss both resulted in higher Sliced Wasserstein Score and better output. Adding Style embedding increased the Sliced Wasserstein Score by a little, but it gave the user the ability to control some features such as hair color and eye color. However we argue that those features should perhaps belong to the content and the style embeddings failed to catch the more subtle yet important style information, such as eye-to-face ratio, texture of the hair, etc., that varies from painter to painter. We thus made the style embedding optional and did not use that for the final results."

The difference between the second (Arnold) and the third (Clyde) place was minuscule (413 vs. 393 frags) and it is questionable whether the order remained the same if games were repeated. There is no doubt, however, that F1 was the best bot beating the forerunner (Arnold) by a large margin. F1 was also characterized by the least number of suicides. Note, however, that generally, the number of suicides is high for all the agents. Interestingly, despite the fact that F1 scored the best, it was Arnold who was gunned down the least often.. Notice also that F1, the winner of Track 1 of the previous competition, took the fifth place with 164 frags and is again characterized by the least number of suicides, which, in general, did not decrease compared to the 2016 competition and is still high for all the agents..

There were no weak bots in Track 1. The spread of the frag count was rather small: the worst bot scored 109 while the best one 248. The track was won by Marvin, which scored 248 frags, only 3 more than the runner-up, Arnold2, and 33 more then Axon. Interestingly, Marvin did not stand out with his accuracy or ability to avoid rockets; it focused on gathering resources: medkits and armors, which greatly increased his chances of survival. Marvin was hit the largest number of times but, at the same time, it was killed the least frequently. Arnold2, on the other hand, was better at aiming (shooting and detection precision).. all could move, aim, and shoot opponents.. The competition was won by Arnold4, who scored 275 frags and was closely followed up by YanShi, who scored 273. Arnold4 was the most accurate bot in the whole competition and the only bot that did not commit any suicide. This turned out to be crucial to win against YanShi, who had the same number of 275 kills but committed two suicides. YanShi, however, achieved the highest frags/death ratio by being the best at avoiding being killed and had the highest detection precision. These two were definitely the best compared to the other agents. The next runner-up, IntelAct, the winner of Track 2 in the previous competition, scored substantially fewer, 221 frags. Fewer items on the maps in Track 2 possibly contributed to the lower position of Marvin, which ended up in the fourth place with 193 frags."

The following four blocks represent the cross check itself.. following four blocks represent the cross check itself. The column Network denotes the network architecture used for the applied optimization.. The column Data Source points to the architecture for which the training set has been generated, with a known error optimum of zero.. For the training runs presented in these rows, the optimum is not known.. It is only known that it would be zero for the architecture given in the column Data Source, but not necessarily also for the architecture of the column Network, used for the fitting.. For example, for the first of these sixteen rows, the network architecture trained is B1 (i.e., a shallow net with a single hidden layer).. It is optimized to fit the training set for which it is known that a zero error can be reached by the architecture B3 (i.e., a deep net with three hidden layers).. The column Ratio to CG displays how many times the error function value attained by the Keras methods was higher than that reached by the conjugate gradient.. The column Deep/Shallow shows the ratio of the following error function values for the deep network and the shallow network.. Shallow networks have been superior for all test problems and all optimizing algorithms.. However, it is interesting to observe that the gap, although always large, was relatively smaller for weakly performing optimization methods (SGD and Adadelta) as well as for large networks."

Additionally, Table 3 shows mean square minima for all size classes using the Keras optimization method RMSprop.. This table elucidates the development of the performance (MSE) with shallow and deep networks for varying network sizes.. Each row shows the performance of a pair of a shallow and a deep network with a comparable number of parameters.. The average performance of a shallow network for a problem for which a zero error minimum is known to be attainable by a deep network is given in the column Data deep – NN shallow.. The average performance of a deep network for a problem for which a zero error minimum is known to be attainable by a shallow network is given in the column Data shallow – NN deep.. The ratio of both average performances is shown in the column Ratio Deep/Shallow.. The difference tends to slightly decrease with the problem size.. The by far weakest method was the SGD, while the best was the conjugate gradient (CG).. Adadelta and RMSprop were performing between the both, with RMSprop sometimes approaching the CG performance.. The difference between the performance with a shallow network on one hand and deep network on the other hand grows with the performance of the optimization method: the difference is relatively small for the worst performing SGD and very large for the best performing CG.. The computing experiments seem to essentially show the superiority of shallow networks in attaining low mean square minima for given mapping problems."

The backbone model column indicates the base transferred very deep network if there was any. Not all architectures used transfer learning, namely FbF CNN and CNN+LSTM. Datasets that the transferred networks were pre-trained on are given in column three. It should be noted again that all architectures were trained with our data for the final classification task. The total number of network parameters for each architecture is shown in column four for assessing the computational load. Lower parameter amount correlates with faster inference time\\. , the fixed number of frames, were changed between 5 to 100 for each configuration. The best scoring. in terms of AUC of each row is given in column five. The final column is the AUC score, the main performance metric of this study. All spatiotemporal architectures with an LSTM layer outperformed their spatial counterparts, except the configuration with the Inceptionresnet  base model, which had the lowest performance. These results underline the importance of the temporal dimension. However, a very large dependence on temporal information is also undesired because; it swells the network, increases the input data size and slows the inference time.. The best result was obtained with the proposed SMT+CNN+LSTM framework which used a Mask R-CNN  semantic mask extractor. We believe this result was due to the masked-contrasted temporal compositions' aptitude for relaying semantic information. The third best result was obtained with an FT+LSTM architecture which used ResNet50  as its backbone model. The rest of the architectures fell behind the top three by a noticeable margin. For example, the proposed SMT+CNN+LSTM's risky lane change detection performance was 25% better than the FbF FT with an Xception backbone."

As depicted in table II, each operation on SalsaNet has a unique improvement on the accuracy. The post processing step leads to certain jump in the accuracy. The highest jump in the model parameters is observed when the new layers are inserted.

For a fair comparison, we measure the inference time of all scans in a sample test scenario (sequence 13) using the same NVIDIA Quadro P6000-24GB GPU card.. Obtained mean runtime. values and standard deviations are reported in Table III. The propsed SalsaNext clearly exhibits better performance compared to the RangeNet++  and has a comparable performance with the original SalsaNet model. Note also that the standard deviation of the SalsaNext runtime is also relatively less than the RangeNet++ , which plays a crucial role in the stability of the self-driving perception modules. Recall also Fig. 1 which shows the overall runtime versus accuracy plot for the state-of-the-art methods and SalsaNext. Consequently, our proposed SalsaNext network inference (a single forward pass) time can reach up to 83 Hz while providing the highest accuracy 54.5%. We here emphasize that this achieved high speed is significantly faster than the sampling rate of mainstream LiDAR scanners which typically work at 10Hz."

    "description": "Table 1 lists the Krippendorf α statistics for the saliency metrics (with varying numbers of deleted pixels L for AOPC). These are calculated on the image-wise rankings of saliency maps, and test \"inter-rater reliability\" as described above. Low α values indicate that the saliency method rankings on different images are inconsistent. The left two columns of table 1 show α values when the baseline edge detection method is included in the ranking. This baseline is ranked more consistently (low rankings for AOPCMoRF and F, high rankings for AOPCLeRF) than the true saliency methods over all data set images, producing higher α values than when it is excluded from the rankings (the right-hand two columns).. Perturbing with random RGB values reduces α for Fidelity and AOPCMoRF compared with mean perturbation, which may be due to the increased stochasticity in the perturbations from the random colour choices. However, it is difficult to understand why AOPCLeRF at smaller numbers of perturbation steps (L = 20 and L = 40) produce greater α values with random RGB perturbation that with mean perturbation. A \"low\" α value is not strictly defined, but α < 0.65 are often considered to indicate unreliability inter-rater reliability. The largest value in the table, 0.48 for AOPCMoRF at L = 100 using mean perturbation and including edge detection in the ranking, is substantially less than 0.65, indicating low inter-rater reliability whatever the specifics of the metric. We can conclude from this that the metrics will not produce consistent rankings of saliency maps when applied to new test images."

A selection of pairs of correlations for different metrics is shown in table 2. The correlation values indicate that the metrics are, in general, not measuring the same underlying quantity across the different saliency methods. Faithfulness is only weakly correlated with AOPCMoRF, and in fact slightly anti-correlated with AOPCLeRF across all saliency methods. The correlation between AOPCMoRF and AOPCLeRF is highly variable across saliency methods, while the most consistent correlations across methods are between AOPCMoRF applied with random RGB versus mean perturbation. This is to be expected as both methods perturb the same pixels — though there is still reasonably high variability even in this case (from ρ = 0.58 for deep Taylor decomposition to ρ = 0.77 for SHAP)."

This may mainly because of the joint use of depth and image for pose estimation (Eq. (5)). In addition, the accuracy is significantly improved by LSTM which incorporates historical information of multiple frames. The enforcement of trajectory consistency also brings about promising improvements in that it enforces geometric consistency among multiple pose estimations. Since depth is improved mainly on edges and details which takes up a small proportion, the accuracy gain is therefore limited. Yet the improved details are very important to RGBD matching for pose regression. Therefore, a slight increase in depth accuracy causes a big improvement in pose estimation."

Although FBKHLT suffers in the classification subtask, it qualifies as a highly competitive system for the detection subtask.. By observing the strict F1 scores, FBK-HLT beats three configurations (DH-FBK100, ILC-ItWack, Berardi2015 Glove) 11, almost equals one (Berardi2015 w2v) 12, and it is outperformed only by one (Fastext-It) 13. In the relaxed evaluation setting, DH-FBK-100 is the only configuration that does not beat FBK-HLT (although the difference is only 0.001 point). Nevertheless, it is remarkable to observe that FBK-HLT has a very high Precision (0.902, relaxed evaluation mode), that is overcome by only one embedding configuration, ILC-ItWack. The results also indicates that word embeddings have a major contribution on Recall,. these results are obtained using a single step approach,"

The ppmi approach in Table 3 builds upon the Count based approach. by using Pointwise Mutual Information values for classification.

Removing the Residual layer and using RELU activation function only, violates the aforementioned component-wise inequality f ((cid:126)x) ≥ (cid:126)x, and has the worst results out of the three. On the other hand, using Residual connections with Tanh activations may not violate the aforementioned inequality, since, it depends upon the sign of the activation outputs. This argument is supported by the results in Table 4, wherein using Tanh activations instead of RELU almost provides identical results, except for the BLESS dataset.

    "description": "The experiment results are presented in Table 2. The best performances of our configurations are highlighted in red, which are 8.37, 3.67, 13.79 and 7.89 for the error rates of our proposed model on AG, Sogou, AG(5k), Sogou(10k) respectively. The bold numbers are the officially reported accuracy of VDCNN, to which our proposed model is close. The numbers in blue are the results coming from our comparison experiment by using VDCNN where we set the sequence length to 256 under word level. From these results we can see that our model outperforms VDCNN on AG News for the official error rate, and is very close to VDCNN's performance on Sogou News. If we set VCDNN with the same input sequence length (256) in word-level, the performance of our proposed model is obviously better.. Most of the contributions come from external matrix From the results of Table 2, in the case of training with a large scale dataset, no matter we use simple LSTM or more complex bi-directional LSTM with self-attention, the testing error rates of different configurations are basically similar to each other. It can be said that such near state-of-the-art performance mainly attributes to the contribution from external memory.. Using abstract to build the external memory is better than contents. From Table 2 we can see that the results of using the description to construct the semantics matrix are better than using the abstract.. SeMemNN can still work on a few-shot learning Table 2 shows that although we have greatly shrank the scale of the training set, our proposed method can still outperform VDCNN. After shrinking the scale of the data, the performance of VDCNN has been greatly decreased, especially for Sogou news, VDCNN has been unable to learn from the training samples."

On the one hand, removing the efficiency-aware loss (β = 0) leads to the increase in model parameter size, on the other hand, a more aggressive efficiency preference (β = 8) results in the small model size but degraded performance, since a large β encourages the compressed model to adopt more lightweight operations such as zero and skip which hurt the performance. A moderate efficiency constraint (β = 4) provides a regularization, guiding the AdaBERT method to achieve a trade-off between the small parameter size and the good performance."

By incorporating the probe models, the performance (line 2 in Table 4) is consistently improved, indicating the benefits from hierarchically decomposed taskoriented knowledge. We then leverage Data Augmentation (DA) to enrich task-oriented knowledge and this technique also improves performance for all tasks, especially for tasks that have a limited scale of data (i.e., MRPC and RTE). DA is also adopted in existing KD-based compression studies (Tang et al., 2019; Jiao et al., 2019). When taking the supervised label knowledge (LCE) into consideration, the performance is further boosted, showing that this term is also important for AdaBERT by providing focused search hints."

We compare the performance of M-BERT with the following models on the multimodal sentiment analysis task: RMFN (SOTA1)1 fuses multimodal information in multiple stages by focusing on a subset of signals in each stage (Liang et al., 2018). MFN (SOTA2) synchronizes states of three separate LSTMs with a multi-view gated memory (Zadeh et al., 2018a). MARN (SOTA3) models view-specific interactions using hybrid LSTM memories and cross-modal interactions using a Multi-Attention Block(MAB) (Zadeh et al., 2018c).. We perform two different evaluation tasks on CMU-MOSI datset: i) Binary Classification, and ii) Regression. We formulate it as a regression problem and report Mean-absolute Error (MAE) and the correlation of model predictions with true labels. Besides, we convert the regression outputs into categorical values to obtain binary classification accuracy (BA) and F1 score.. The performances of M-BERT and BERT are described in Table 1.. M-BERT model outperforms all the baseline models (described in Sec.4.4) on every evaluation metrics with large margin. It sets new state-of-the-art performance for this task and achieves 84.38% accuracy, a 5.98% increase with respect to the SOTA1 and 1.02% increase with respect to BERT (text-only).. Even BERT (text-only) model achieves 83.36% accuracy, an increase of 4.96% from the SOTA1 78.4%, using text information only. It achieves higher performance in all evaluation metrics compare to SOTA1; reinforcing the expressiveness and utility of BERT contextual representation."

The number of replacement for Min-Grad is comparable with random.. Table IV shows that Transformer is more robust to our proposed method than BLSTM. This is because our proposed method has less number of replacements and lower success rate in case of Transformer than BLSTM for both the language pairs. Interestingly, HotFlip has higher success rate and similar number of replacement in case for Transformer than BLSTM. Overall, as is evident from Table IV, our proposed method (Min-Grad + Soft-Att) achieves the highest success rate across the NMT models..

TaggedBT closes this gap and passes standard BT by +0.4 BLEU, for a total gain of +1.0 BLEU over NoisedBT.. We further investigate the effects of TaggedBT by performing one round of iterative backtranslation (Cotterell and Kreutzer, 2018; Vu Cong Duy Hoang and Cohn, 2018; Niu et al., 2018), and find another difference between the different varieties of BT: NoisedBT and TaggedBT allow the model to bootstrap improvements from an improved reverse model, whereas standard BT does not..

We find that the iteration-3 BT models improve over their Iteration-1 counterparts only for NoisedBT (+1.0 BLEU, dev+test avg) and TaggedBT (+0.7 BLEU, dev+test avg), whereas the Iteration-3 BT model shows no improvement over its Iteration-1 counterpart (-0.1 BLEU, dev+test avg).. iteration-3 TaggedBT (Table 4),.

    "description": "The comparison between BERT embeddings and other models is presented in Table 3. Overall, in-domain fine-tuned BERT delivers the best performance. We report new state-of-the-art results on WikiPassageQA (33% improvement in MAP) and InsuranceQA (version 1.0) (3.6% improvement in P@1) by supervised fine-tuning BERT using pairwise rank hinge loss. When evaluated on non-factoid QA datasets, there is a big gap between BERT embeddings and the fully fine-tuned BERT, which suggests that deep interactions between questions and answers are critical to the task. However, the gap is much smaller for factoid QA datasets. Since non-factoid QA depends more on content matching rather than vocabulary matching, the results are kind of expected. Similar to BERT for sentence embeddings, mean-pooling and combining the top and bottom layer embeddings lead to better performance, and (u, v, u ∗ v, |u − v|) shows the strongest results among other interaction schemes. Different from sentence-level embeddings, fine-tuning BERT on SNLI doesn't lead to significant improvement, which suggests possible domain mismatch between SNLI and the QA datasets. MLP layer usually provided a 1-2 percent boost in performance compared to the logistic regression layer. For WikiPassageQA, BERT embeddings perform comparably as BM25 baseline. For InsuranceQA, BERT embeddings outperform a strong representation-based matching model DSSM (Huang et al., 2013), but still far behind the state-of-the-art interaction-based model SUBMULT+NN (Wang and Jiang, 2016) and fully fine-tuned BERT. On factoid datasets (Quasar-t and SearchQA), BERT embeddings outperform BM25 baseline significantly."

Altogether, these two systems exhibit significantly better average performances than all other models surveyed here, both those relying on and those not relying on hand-crafted features (p ≤ 0.05).. The performance of the learners is quite divergent across datasets, with Macro-F1 scores6 ranging from 60% (WTP) to 80% (MT), average 67% (see Table 2).. On all datasets, our best systems clearly outperform both baselines. In isolation, lexical, embedding, and syntax features are most helpful, whereas structural features did not help in most cases. Discourse features only contribute significantly on MT. When looking at the performance of the feature-based approaches, the most striking finding is the importance of lexical (in our setup, unigram) information."

Our extended approach COALA p-means improves the performance of COALA on these datasets by an additional 1.6pp. The proposed power mean aggregation achieves a strong improvement on four datasets and results in a small performance decrease in the remaining three cases.. The results in Table 2 show that our proposed syntax-aware extension COALA syntax-aware, which incorporates syntactic roles of word sequences to learn syntax-aware aspect representations, improves the results in five out of seven cases.. It thereby achieves an an average improvement of 0.7pp over COALA in our cQA datasets."

The feat model slightly outperforms the auto. auto-rank + feat model is slightly better than the auto-rank + bm25 model, both of which have the overall best performance. This shows, that the auto-encoder learns something orthogonal to term frequency and document length. The best model with respect to document ranking is the auto-rank + feat model. In Figure 3 we show the correlation between the different models. Interestingly, the bm25 and the feat strongly correlate. However, the scores of bm25 do not correlate with the scores of the combination of auto-rank and bm25. This indicates, that the model does not primarily learn to use the bm25 score but also focuses on the the auto-encoded representation. This underlines the hypothesis that the auto-encoder is able to represent latent features of the relationship of the query terms in the document. rank model. The distance features are a strong indicator for the semantic dependency between entities. These relationships need to be learned in the auto-rank model. The cosine similarity of a query and a document (auto/cos) does not yield a good result. This shows that the auto-encoder has learned many features, most of which do not correlate with our task.

Otherwise the prediction of the sentence will be propaganda even if the majority of the prediction probability mass was for the non-propaganda class. This was a way to handle the unbalance in the training data without having to discard part of the data. The 0.70 threshold was chosen after elaborate experiments on both the local and the shared-task's development sets. This condition consistently provided an improvement of around 5 points in F1 score of the propaganda class on all experiments using different sets of features as shown in Table 2.. In SLC, we ran multiple experiments using BERT with and without additional features as shown in Table 2. The features include using the text passed as is to BERT without any preprocessing. Also, we experimented with adding the context which includes the two sentences that come before and after the target sentence. Context sentences were concatenated and passed as the second BERT input, while the target sentence was passed as the first BERT input. In addition, we experimented with using BERT logits (i.e., the probability predictions per class) as features in a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier concatenated with handcrafted features (e.g., LIWC, quotes, questions), and with predictions of our FLC classifier (tagged spans: whether the sentence has a propaganda fragment or not). However, none of these features added any statistically significant improvements. Therefore, we used BERT predictions for our final model with a condition to predict the majority class non-propaganda only if its prediction probability is more than 0.70 as shown in Table 3. This is a modified threshold as opposed to 0.80 in the experiments shown in Table 2 to avoid overfitting on a one dataset. The final threshold of 0.70 was chosen after experiments on both the local and shared task development sets, which also represents the ratio of the non-propaganda class in the training set."

However, this resulted on lower 2https://www.urbandictionary.com/ 3https://data.world/jaredfern/urban-dictionary embedding. In FLC, we only show the results of our best model in Table 5 to focus more on the differences between propaganda techniques. A more elaborate study of performance of different models should follow in future work. The best model is a BiLSTM-CRF with flair and urban glove embed. As we can see in Table 5, we can divide the propaganda techniques into three groups according to the model's performance on the development and test sets. The first group includes techniques with non-zero F1 scores on both datasets: Flag-Waving, Loaded Language, Name Calling,Labeling and Slogans. This group has techniques that appear frequently in the data and/or techniques with strong lexical signals (e.g. \"American People\" in Flag-Waving) or punctuation signals (e.g. quotes in Slogans). The second group has the techniques with a nonzero F1 score on only one of the datasets but not the other, such as: Appeal to Authority, Appeal to Fear, Doubt, Reduction, and Exaggeration,Minimisation. Two out of these five techniques (Appeal to Fear and Doubt) have very small non-zero F1 on the development set which indicates that they are generally challenging on our model and were only tagged due to minor differences between the two datasets. However, the remaining three types show significant drops from development to test sets or vice-versa. This requires further analysis to understand why the model was able to do well on one dataset but get zero on the other dataset, which we leave for future work. The third group has the remaining nine techniques were our sequence tagger fails to correctly tag any text span on either dataset. This group has the most infrequent types as well as types beyond the ability for our tagger to spot by looking at the sentence only such as Repetition.. Overall, our model has the highest precision among all teams on both datasets, which could be due to adding the UBY. one-hot encoded features that highlighted some strong signals for some propaganda types. This also could be the reason for our model to have the lowest recall among the top 7 teams on both datasets as having explicit handcrafted signals suffers from the usual sparseness that accompanies these kinds of representations which could have made the model more conservative in tagging text spans."

Tables 4 and 5 show that the Relevance Model outperforms the Rocchio algorithm in every aspect. Both models outperform the auto-encoder approach (auto-ref ). We suspect that summing over the encodings distorts the individual features too much for a correct extraction of relevant entities to be possible. The combination of all three models (auto-ref + rocchio + relevance) outperforms the other models in most cases. Especially the performance for ranking of entity terms is increased using the autoencoded features. However, it is interesting to see that the rocchio + relevance model outperforms the recall for second and third best terms. This indicates that for user-evaluated term suggestions, the inclusion of the auto-encoded features is advisable. For automatic query refinement however, in average, this is not the case."

However, the accuracy of the baseline drops for ambiguous predicates (69.73 %) and the F1-macro score reveals its weakness toward minority classes (drop from 64.54 % to 37.42 %).. Our unimodal system trained and evaluated on English data slightly exceeds the accuracy of the previous state of the art (88.66 % on average versus 88.41 % for Hermann et al., 2014); our best run's accuracy is 89.35 %..

Our system evaluated on German data sets a new state of the art on this corpus with 80.76 % accuracy, outperforming the baselines (77.16 %; no other system evaluated on this dataset).. We report results achieved without the lexicon to evaluate independently of its quality (Hartmann et al., 2017). On English data, our systems outperforms Hartmann et al. (2017) by more than two points in accuracy and we achieve a large improvement over the Data Baseline. Comparing the F1-macro with and without lexicon, it can be seen that the additional information stored in the lexicon strongly increases the score by about 20 points for English data. For German data, the increase of F1-macro with lexicon versus without is small (one point)."

    "description": "For 107 out of the 200 documents, an incorrect and correct summary is among the 5 alternatives. Table 2 shows that in this sample from the validation data, the fraction of incorrect summaries at first position, when the 5 alternatives are ranked as during beam search, is at 42.1%.. Using entailment probabilities of ESIM and InferSent, we can slightly improve upon that and reduce incorrect summaries. However, with DA and SSE, more incorrect summaries end up in the first position. Note that these results are not in line with the model's NLI accuracies, underlining that performance on NLI does not directly transfer to our task. Only for BERT, which outperforms the other models on NLI by a large margin, we also see substantially better reranking performance. But even for this powerful model, more than half of the errors still remain in the summaries.5 Interestingly, we also find that for ESIM and InferSent, reranking hurts in many cases, leaving just a few cases of net improvement.. Given the validation results, we then applied reranking to the CNN-DM test data followed by a post-hoc correctness evaluation as in Section 4. We used the ESIM model and reranked all 10. beam hypotheses generated by FAS.6 In contrast to the validation sample, the fraction of incorrect summaries increases from 26% to 29% (Table 2), demonstrating that the slight improvement on the validation data does not transfer to the test set."

In the DISJOINT setting, however, LEAR is left \"blind\" as it has not seen a single test word in the constraints: it leaves distributional vectors of *BLESS test words identical. In this setting, LEAR performance is equivalent to the original distributional space. In contrast, learning to generalize the LE specialization function from LEAR-specializations of other words, POSTLE models are able to successfully LE-specialize vectors of test *BLESS words.

Although a vast majority of the context posts contain 3-4 sentences, around 100 context posts have more than ten sentences and thus we set a cutoff to a maximum of ten sentences for context modeling. For the reply r we considered the entire reply.. The SV Mbl models that are based on discrete features did not perform very well, and adding context actually hurt the performance. Regarding the performance of the neural network models, we observe that modeling context improves the performance using all types of LSTM architectures that read both context (c) and reply (r). The highest performance when considering both the S and. S classes is achieved by the LSTMconditional model (73.32% F1 for S class and 70.56% F1 for. S, showing a 6% and 3% improvement over LSTMr for S and. S classes, respectively). The LSTM model with sentence-level attentions on both context and reply (LSTMcas +LSTMras ) gives the best F1 score of 73.7% for the S class. For the. S class, while we notice an improvement in precision we notice a drop in recall when compared to the LSTM model with sentence level attention only on reply (LSTMras ).. We observe the performance (69.88% F1 for S category) deteriorates, probably due to the lack of enough training data."

The lowest performance is obtained with the Majority baseline which achieves 33.3% weighted Fscore (66.7% F-score for non-sarcastic class and 0% for sarcastic). The pre-trained features for the visual modality provide the best performance among the unimodal variants. The addition of textual features through concatenation improves the unimodal baseline and achieves the best performance. The tri-modal variant is unable to achieve the best score due to a slightly sub-optimal performance from the audio modality. Overall, the combination of visual and textual signals significantly improves over the unimodal variants, with a relative error rate reduction of up to 12.9%.. In multiple evaluations, the multimodal variants were shown to significantly outperform their unimodal counterparts, with relative error rate reductions of up to 12.9%."

Table 1 are trained in the same conditions that our model with glove initialization with dual-channel overlapping non-static pre-trained embedding on the same dataset..

In contrast, S-LSTM gives a development result of 82.64%, which is significantly better compared to 2-layer stacked BiLSTM, with a smaller number of model parameters and a shorter time of 65 seconds.. We additionally make comparisons with stacked CNNs and hierarchical attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), shown in Table 3 (the CNN and Transformer rows),. CNN is the most efficient among all models compared, with the smallest model size. On the other hand, a 3-layer stacked CNN gives an accuracy of 81.46%, which is also. the lowest compared with BiLSTM, hierarchical attention and S-LSTM. The best performance of hierarchical attention is between single-layer and two-layer BiLSTMs in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. S-LSTM gives significantly better accuracies compared with both CNN and hierarchical attention.. Table 3 additionally shows the results of BiLSTM and S-LSTM when external attention is used. Attention leads to improved accuracies for both BiLSTM and S-LSTM in classification, with S-LSTM still outperforming BiLSTM significantly."

As we can see from the bottom part of the table, all models struggle more with getting the content right than with producing linguistically correct texts; 70-80% of the texts generated by all models are completely correct linguistically.. Comparing the two datasets, we again observe that the WebNLG dataset is much more challenging than the E2E dataset, especially with respect to correctly verbalizing the content.. Moreover, spelling mistakes only appeared in WebNLG texts, mainly concerning omissions of accents or umlauts.. The most frequent content error in both datasets concerns omission of information.. Information addition and repetition only occur in the WebNLG dataset. The latter is an especially frequent problem of the character-based model, affecting more than a quarter of all texts.. In comparison, character-based models reproduce the content more faithfully on the E2E dataset while offering the same level of linguistic quality as word-based models, leading to more correct outputs overall. On the WebNLG dataset, the word-based model is more faithful to the inputs, probably because of the effective delexicalization strategy, whereas the character-based model errs less on the linguistic side. Overall, the word-based model yields more correct texts, stressing the importance of delexicalization and data normalization in low resource settings."

As is evident from the first two rows, all models learned to generalize from the training data to produce correct texts for novel inputs consisting of unseen combinations of input attributes.. Yet, the picture is a bit different for the model trained on data generated by both templates. While the top two hypotheses are equally distributed between adhering to Template 1 and Template 2, more than 5% among the lower-ranked hypotheses constitute a template combination such as the example shown in the bottom part of Figure 2.. As can be seen in the final row of Table 7, this simple reranker successfully places correct hypotheses higher up in the ranking, improving the practical usability of the generation model by now offering almost three correct variants for each input among the top five hypotheses on average."

    "description": "We evaluate two configurations of the parse decoder, one in which it is trained separately from the token decoder (first column of Table 3), and the other where both decoders are trained jointly (second column of Ta. ble 3). We observe that joint training boosts the chunk F1 from 65.4 to 69.6, although, in both cases the F1 scores are relatively low, which matches our intuition as most source sentences can be translated into multiple target syntactic forms.. To measure how often the token decoder follows the predicted chunk sequence, we parse the generated translation and compute the F1 between the resulting chunk sequence and the parse decoder's prediction (fourth column of Table 3). Strong results of 89.9 F1 and 43.1% exact match indicate that the token decoder is heavily reliant on the generated chunk sequences.. The resulting F1 is indeed almost 10 points higher (third column of Table 3), indicating that the token decoder does have the ability to correct mistakes.. In Section 5.3 (see the final row of Table 3) we consider the effect of randomly sampling the max chunk size k during training. This provides a considerable boost to BLEU with a minimal impact to speedup."

Decoding the next sentence performed similarly to decoding the subsequent contiguous words. 2. Decoding the subsequent 30 words, which was adopted from the skip-thought training code3, gave reasonably good performance. More words for decoding didn't give us a significant performance gain, and took longer to train. 3. Adding more layers into the decoder and enlarging the dimension of the convolutional layers indeed sightly improved the performance on the three downstream tasks, but as training efficiency is one of our main concerns, it wasn't worth sacrificing training efficiency for the minor performance gain. 4. Increasing the dimensionality of the RNN encoder improved the model performance, and the additional training time required was less than needed for increasing the complexity in the CNN decoder. We report results from both smallest and largest models in Table 2.. As the transferability of the models trained in both cases perform similarly on the evaluation tasks (see rows 1 and 2 in Table 4), we focus on the simpler predictall-words CNN decoder that learns to reconstruct the next window of contiguous words.. As stated in rows 1, 3, and 4 in Table 4, decoding short target sequences results in a slightly lower Pearson score on SICK, and decoding longer target sequences lead to a longer training time.. We tweaked the CNN encoder, including different kernel size and activation function, and we report the best results of CNNCNN model at row 6 in Table 4.. The future predictor in (Gan et al., 2017) also applies a CNN as the encoder, but the decoder is still an RNN, listed at row 11 in Table 4. Compared to our designed CNN-CNN model, their CNN-LSTM model contains more parameters than our model does, but they have similar performance on the evaluation tasks, which is also worse than our RNNCNN model.. Clearly, we can tell from the comparison between rows 1, 9 and 12 in Table 4, increasing the dimensionality of the RNN encoder leads to better transferability of the model.. Compared with the model with larger-size CNN decoder, apparently, we can see that larger encoder size helps more than larger decoder size does (rows 7,8, and 9 in Table 4)."

    "reasoning": "The incremental dynamic approach outperforms other baselines in the all pairs scenario, especially when including OOV words, due to its ability to incrementally update and expand vocabulary.",
    "description": "Table 3 presents the results for these experiments, as well as baselines (averaged across 15 years). For the proposed incr. dynamic approach, the performance of the previous projections is. comparable to that of the up-to-now projections on the accuracies @5 and @10, and is even higher on the accuracy @1 (statistically significant with t-test, p < 0.01). Thus, the single-year projections are somewhat more 'focused', while taking much less time to learn, because of less training pairs. The fact that our models were incrementally updated, not trained from scratch, is crucial. The results of the separate baseline look more like random jitter. The cumulative baseline results are slightly better, probably simply because they are trained on more data. However, they still perform much worse than the models trained using incremental updates. This is because the former models are not connected to each other, and thus are initialized with a different layout of words in the vector space. This gives rise to formally different directions of semantic relations in each yearly model (the relations themselves are still there, but they are rotated and scaled differently). The results for the incr. static baseline, when tested only on the words present in the test model vocabulary (the left part of the table), seem better than those of the proposed incr. dynamic approach. This stems from the fact that incremental updating with static vocabulary means that we never add new words to the models; thus, they contain only the vocabulary learned from the 1994 texts. The result is that at test time we skip many more pairs than with the other approaches (about 62% in average). Subsequently, the projections are tested only on a minor part of the test sets. Of course, skipping large parts of the data would be a major drawback for any realistic application, so the incr. static baseline is not really plausible. For comparison, the right part of Table 3 provides the accuracies for the setup in which all the pairs are evaluated (for pairs with OOV words the accuracy is always 0). Other tested approaches are not much affected by this change, but for incr. static the performance drops drastically. As a result, for the all pairs scenario, incremental updating with vocabulary expansion outperforms all the baselines (the differences are statistically significant with t-test, p < 0.01)."

The combination of losses L∗ shows mixed results, and has lower performance for S-TLM and C-TLM, but better performance for TL2RTL.. Moreover, we can clearly see that on TE3‡, CTLM performs better than the indirect models, across all loss functions..

There was relatively little variation in grammaticality or time across the conditions.. Priming had a major impact, with the shift to lexical examples leading to a significant improvement in correctness, but much lower diversity. The surprising increase in correctness when providing no examples. changing the incentives by providing either a bonus for novelty, or no bonus at all, did not substantially impact any of the metrics.. Changing the number of paraphrases written by each worker did not significantly impact diversity (we worried that collecting more than one may lead to a decrease).. the One Paraphrase condition did have lower grammaticality,.

Compared with WM18, our RGB model outperforms under all conditions.. According to the cosine similarity, the HSV model is superior for most test conditions (confirming our hypothesis about simpler modifier behaviour in this space). However for Delta-E, the RGB model and ensemble perform better. Unlike cosine, Delta-E is sensitive to differences in vector length, and we would argue it is the most appropriate metric because lengths are critical to measuring the extent of lightness and darkness of colors. Accordingly the HSV model does worse under this metric, as it more directly models the direction of color modifiers, but as a consequence this leads to errors in its length predictions. Over- all the ensemble does well according to both met rics, and has the best performance for several test conditions with Delta-E."

Semantic features which are associated with the gist representation of content are particularly interesting to see among the predictors since based on Fuzzytrace theory (Reyna, 2012), a well-known theory of decision making under risk, gist representation of content drives individual's decision to spread misinformation online. Also among the significant features, we observe the causal connectives, that are proven to be important in text comprehension, and two indices related to the text easability and readability, both suggesting that satire articles are more sophisticated, or less easy to read, than fake news articles."

    "description": "Table 1: Average performance (and standard deviations) on discrete and continuous control unseen tasks over the last 50 episodes.. In the discrete case, MAML showed a clear improvement over starting from a random initial policy. However, using the advisor with PPO resulted in a clear improvement in pole-balancing and, in the case of animat, training the advisor with REINFORCE led to an almost 50% improvement over MAML. In the case of continuous control, the first test corresponds to a continuous version of pole-balancing. The second and third set of tasks correspond to the \"Hopper\" and \"Ant\" problem classes, where the task variations were obtained by modifying the length and size of the limbs and body. In all continuous control tasks, using the advisor and MAML led to an clear improvement in performance in the alloted time. In the case of pole-balancing using the advisor led the agent to accumulate almost twice as much reward as MAML, and in the case of Hopper, the advisor led to accumulating 4 times the reward. On the other had, MAML achieved a higher average return in the Ant problem class, but showing high variance. An important takeaway from these results is that in all cases, using the advisor resulted in a clear improvement in performance over a limited number of episodes. This does not necessarily mean that the agent can reach a better policy over an arbitrarily long period of time, but rather that it is able to reach a certain performance level much quicker."

According to Table III, when testing on the CAN-intrusion data set, the tree-based algorithms including DT, RF, ET, and XGBoost used in the proposed system are 2.5% more accurate than KNN and 3.4% more accurate than SVM used in . In addition, multi-threading is enabled in DT, RF, ET, and XGBoost, resulting in a lower execution time compared with KNN and SVM. Since XGBoost has the lowest accuracy and longest execution time among the four tree-based ML models, only the other three algorithms, DT, RF, and ET were selected into the stacking ensemble model, and the single model with best performance, RF, was selected to be the meta-classifier in the second layer. After using stacking to combine the three tree-based models, the accuracy, detection rate and F1 score reaches 100%, which means that all the trained attacks can be detected.. From Tables III and IV, it can be seen that RF and XGBoost are the singular models with best accuracy on CAN-intrusion data set and CICIDS2017 data set, respectively. As single base models have lower execution time than the ensemble model, these two singular models were also tested after feature selection. For CAN-intrusion data set, the top-4 important features, CAN ID, 'DATA', 'DATA', 'DATA' were selected for the tests. The results of RF and stacking on CANintrusion data set after feature selection, named \"FS RF\" and \"FS Stacking\", can be seen from Table III."

    "description": "In Table 1 we report error metrics relevant for motion prediction: displacement errors, as well as along-track and cross-track errors , averaged over the prediction horizon.. Considering the baselines, we see that the linear model. easily outperformed the baseline UKF, which simply propagates an initial actor state. Moreover, using the map information through the lane-assoc model we gained significant improvements, especially in the cross-track which is already at the level of the best deep models.. We then conducted an ablation study using the feedforward architecture from Figure 2 and AlexNet as a base CNN, running experiments with varying input complexity (upper half of Table 1). When we provide neither fading nor state inputs the model performs worse than UKF, as the network does not have enough information to estimate current state of an actor from the raster. Interestingly, when we include fading the model starts to outperform the baseline by a large margin, indicating that actor state can be inferred solely from providing past positions through fading. If instead of fading we directly provide state estimates we get even better performance, as the state info is already distilled and does not need to be estimated from raster. Furthermore, using raster with fading together with state inputs leads to additional performance boost, suggesting that fading carries additional info not available through the state itself, and that the raster and other external inputs can be seamlessly combined through the proposed architecture to improve accuracy.. Next, we compared popular CNN architectures as base CNNs. As seen in the bottom half of Table 1, we found that VGG and ResNet models provide improvements over the baseline AlexNet, as observed previously . It is interesting to note that only starting with these models did we outperform the baseline lane-assoc model in terms of all the relevant metrics. However, both models are outperformed by the novel MNv2 architecture that combines a number of deep learning ideas under one roof (e.g., bottleneck layers, residual connections, depthwise convolutions). Taking the best performing MNv2 as a base and extending the output layer by adding uncertainty led to further improvements.. Lastly, using LSTM decoder at the output, as described in Section 3.3, led to the best results. In our task the future states depend on the past ones, which can be captured by the recurrent architecture."

We show accuracy on Ytest and on Yiso (in brackets) in Table 4. Experimentation details can be found in Appendix G. From Table 4 we can conclude that peering model on homogeneous data is always the top performer. This is aligned with the result of Theorem 6.1, which guarantees that acc(Yiso) = 1, but it is an interesting observation if we compare it to the peering model on all isomorphic instances Yiso (-P models). Moreover, the latter model often loses even to the original model, where no information from the train set is explicitly taken into the test set."

All proposed methods perform significantly better than SD. We can see that all methods in (A), (B), and (C). of Table 2 outperform SD by a large margin of 9-15%.. On the other hand, our proposed methods achieve significantly better results and almost reach the same accuracy as SPV with a gap of 1-4%.. MF-LF-BS performs well in all cases. We can see that different algorithms perform best under different settings, but MF-LF-BS always performs best or has no statistical difference from the best methods.. Balancing soft labels helps improve accuracy. While the improvement may be marginal (less than 1.5%), we can see that 'BS' methods in (C) consistently outperform their 'E' counterparts in (A). Surprisingly, SD-BS, which is SD with balanced soft labels, also significantly improved over SD by more than 10%.. All methods perform rather well. We can see that all methods, including SD, achieve about the same accuracy (within ~1% range).. Not balancing soft labels performs better. We note that balancing soft labels tends to slightly deteriorate the accuracy. This is the opposite result from the random classes case. Here, even SD-BS which receive an accuracy boost in the random classes case also performs worse than its counterpart SD.. Distillation may outperform its supervised counterparts. For LSUN and Places365 datasets, we see that many times distillation methods performs better than SPV. Especially for the case of VGG16, we see SPV consistently perform worse than other methods by 1 to 3% in most of the trials."

For both constrained and unconstrained perturbations, the total time in seconds, average time in seconds, and the average number of DE iterations are presented. Five runs for constrained and unconstrained one-pixel adversarial perturbations show that constrained perturbations converge faster.. The results for the CIFAR-10 and NIPS-W datasets are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively.. It can be clearly observed that across different runs and on average, the constrained one-pixel adversarial perturbations converged faster with comparatively less number of iterations when compared to conventional one-pixel adversarial perturbations.. This effect is more pronounced for CIFAR10, with the spatially constrained one-pixel adversarial perturbations converging 6× faster than conventional attacks."

Based on inception scores, our DCGAN variant of the chain generator using multiple critics (model 2 and 4) was able to outperform the base DCGAN model (model 6) while using fewer parameters..

    "description": "Suppose we have. model owners and P clients, as illustrated in Fig. 1, for every client we need to generate a joint key for this client and the group of. model owners; that is, we will need to produce and maintain P joint keys. This also means that each model owner has to provide P copies of the encrypted model to the cloud.. For our collaborative machine learning scenario, an MKHE solution will require each ciphertext to be extended to. + 1 different keys (i.e., the model owners keys plus the key of the requesting client) before any computation. The efficiency of the system is affected especially if the number of model owners is large because it proportionally increases the ciphertext size.. Also, we reduce the number of encrypted models from P to 1 and the dimension of the extended ciphertexts from (N + 1) × 2 to 2 × 2.. Table. provides a summary of our comparison.. This approach also means that each model owner must prepare P encrypted copies of their models to the cloud, one for each distinct joint key.. As an alternative, participants can encrypt their inputs under their individual keys, but extend them to additional keys using the MKHE scheme at evaluation. This way, the model owners delegate one encryption copy of their models to the cloud. When a client Ci requests an evaluation, each SWHE ciphertext c = (c0, c1) is extended to one in the form ¯c = {cM1| . . . |cMN |cCi } ∈ R2(N +1)q under the set of. + 1 keys {pkM1 , . . . , pkMN , pkCi}, resulting in linear expansion of the ciphertext size. Our proposed approach leverages both the threshold and multi-key HE techniques. There is no need to set up a joint key for each client with the model owners, and ciphertexts are extended only under two different keys instead of. + 1 keys resulting in a reduction in the ciphertext size.. reduces the number of encryption of the same model, and (iii) reduces the ciphertext size with dimension reduction from (N + 1) × 2 to 2 × 2. We presented the detail design of this approach and analyzed the complexity and security."

    "description": "Results are listed in Table II. We can see that DT yields lots of infeasible predictions if we do not take joint limits into account (λ = 0). The more joints are used,. the higher the chance to violate at least one joint limit. If the penalty factor λ is increased, the percentage of infeasible predictions η decreases to about 1% and for higher values of λ potentially even further. The downside of this approach is a significant increase of the position and orientation errors. The highest increase is noticed for the 6-DoF mechanism where the errors increase approximately by a factor of four. This means that the sample efficiency of DT is worse if we consider joint limits as we need a much larger number of training samples"

Further, we compare our proposed algorithm with autoregressive GP (ARGP), autoregressive GP with BOCPD (ARGPBOCPD), GP time series with BOCPD (BOCPD) and GP time series model (GPTS).. Table 2 shows the predictive performance of our proposed algorithm compared to other GP based BOCPD methods. In Nile data, we see that combining BOCPD method with GP improves the performance. CBOCPD further improves the performance by leveraging the proposed statistical hypothesis tests and outperforms all other algorithms. In Well Log data, the nonlinear temporal correlations within each regime give a slight advantage to underlying predictive model of ARGP. However, CBOCPD still shows the competitive result.

The features derived from region risk analysis also have good correlation with crime count for both cities, especially overnight.

    "description": "Table 2 reports the comparison results among the selected baselines for CDR. Note that in each domain pair, the chosen categories are as irrelevant as possible, so that we can better examine the performance of our model on learning and transfering knowledge from the rating matrix only. It is obvious that DL-based approaches (i.e., CoNet and DARec) are superior to non-deep models. This can be explained by the. ability of nonlinearity modelling from the deep neural networks. Also, MF-based mehtods perform better when the source domain dataset is relatively dense, but the datasets we consider in this work are of high sparsity (over 99.8%). For example, in the Office Products and Movies & TV dataset with 90% training data, CoNet gains 2.38% RMSE improvement over FM-CDCF and I-DARec achieves 3.45% over FMCDCF. This result shows that DL-based methods are more suitable for extreme sparse datasets, which is in consistency with the findings in [Hu, 2018]. Furthermore, we notice that CoNet performs better than U-DARec as U-DARec adopts adversarial training to balance the extraction of shared user rating patterns and the pursuit of high rating prediction accuracy. This weakness is overcome by I-DARec which minimizes the losses of domain classifier and rating predictor at the same time. Thus, as we can see, I-DARec achieves the best performance among the baselines."

The supervised DDSP Autoencoder and WaveRNN models use the fundamental frequency from a pretrained CREPE model, while the unsupervised DDSP autoencoder learns to infer the frequency from the audio during training.. For the NSynth dataset, we quantitatively compare the quality of DDSP resynthesis with that of a state-of-the-art baseline using WaveRNN (Hantrakul et al., 2019). The models are comparable as they are trained on the same data, provided the same conditioning, and both targeted towards realtime synthesis applications. In Table 1, we compute loudness and fundamental frequency (F0) L1 metrics described in Section. of the appendix. Despite the strong performance of the baseline, the supervised DDSP autoencoder still outperforms it, especially in F0 L1. This is not unexpected, as the additive synthesizer directly uses the conditioning frequency to synthesize audio. The unsupervised DDSP autoencoder must learn to infer its own F0 conditioning signal directly from the audio. As described in Section B.4, we improve optimization by also adding a perceptual loss in the form of a pretrained CREPE network (Kim et al., 2018). While not as accurate as the supervised DDSP version, the model does a fair job at learning to generate sounds with the correct frequencies without supervision, outperforming the supervised WaveRNN model."

From the table, BM3D (in combination with VST) is still the most versatile traditional denoising algorithm regarding its high PSNR and relatively fast denoising speed. PURE-LET, though its PSNR is not the highest, is the fastest denoising method among all the benchmarked algorithms thanks to its specific design for Poisson-Gaussian denoising. Finally, deep learning models outperform the other 8 methods by a significant margin in all noise levels, both in terms of PSNR and SSIM, even thought they are blind to noise levels. This is different from the observation made before in [1, 24], probably because the nature of Poisson dominated noise is different from Gaussian noise while most of the denoising methods are developed for Gaussian noise model. Even if we applied the VST before Gaussian denoising, the transformed noise may still be different from a pure Gaussian one. More importantly, here the models are re-trained with our FMD dataset instead of pre-trained on other datasets."

Moving forward, we see that the four unconstrained models, UM, UM-velo, UM-LSTM, and UM-heading gave strong results in terms of the center position prediction.. the results are near-identical, and both have about 30% of their trajectories being kinematically infeasible,. It is interesting to discuss UM-LSTM, which showed good performance in terms of position errors but poor in terms of heading and infeasibility metrics.. The UM-heading model, which predicts both positions and headings, has better heading and infeasibility metrics com. pared to UM. However, around 20% of the predicted are still kinematically infeasible. However, when compared to unconstrained models it is clear that the method underperformed, although it is competitive in terms of kinematic feasibility..

As can be seen, our proposed DSRC method similar to the experiments with SVHN provides remarkable improvements as compared to the other SRC methods. This clearly shows that more. challenging datasets are better represented by our method."

The inference errors for the robot joints are shown in Table I, along with the errors for the estimation of the location of the ball at the time of interception.. Results in Table. show that attempting to model the demonstrations with a parametric Gaussian model yields a poor approximation and leads to an incorrect estimate of the initial uncertainty. This is supported by the fact that both BIP (Gaussian prior) and eBIP− (mixture model prior) produce predictions that are many orders of magnitude from the true state.. However, we see from Table. that BIP yields a 1.04 × 1015 joint prediction MSE error when 82% of the ball trajectory is observed while eBIP− only yields a joint prediction MSE of 10.52.. These results also show that both the PF and eBIP− produce worse inference results as the number of active modalities increases. For example, the PF predictions result in a joint MSE of 0.11 when only the trajectory of the ball was observed, but a MSE of 0.26 when all modalities were observed.. Lastly, we observe that the introduction of additional modalities does not always yield an increase in inference accuracy, although it may provide other benefits depending on the modalities. This is evident when comparing the joint MSE prediction errors of eBIP for the {Shoe, IMU} data set and that of the {Shoe, IMU, Head} data set. The introduction of the head modality actually increases the inference error when 43% of the trajectory is observed, which is when the head modality is most relevant."

Notice that the discriminative training improves the performance, specifically for Boolean and integer types.. Note that the training has a slightly negative effect on float and string types, but it still performs better than the other methods.. It is noticeable from Table 2 that dates are difficult to infer accurately.. The large performance gap for Booleans suggests that our method handles confusions with integers and strings better. Analysis shows that such confusions occur respectively in the presence of {0, 1}, and {Yes, No}. We further note that F#, messytables, and readr perform similarly, especially on floats, integers, and strings; which is most likely explained by the fact that they employ similar heuristics."

Different proportions are used in the experiment for integrity. The results show that the proposed encoding method can represent an architecture better than without using it, and the KTau indicator increases about 0.14 when using MSE loss and 0.05 when using pairwise loss. When using pairwise loss instead of element-wise MSE loss, the KTau indicator increases about 0.26 when using only the type matrix as feature, and about 0.17 when using the proposed feature tensor. It means that pairwise loss is better than MSE loss at ranking regardless of input feature.. Peephole. shows better result than proposed v1 method. However, it performs worse than proposed v2 method. E2EPP used random forest as predictor, which has advantages only when the training samples are extremely rare. When using limited training data, the proposed method with loss function L (Eq. 5) achieves the best KTau performance, while the proposed. method with L1 loss (Eq. 3) is better when more training data is used. The results show that generating features with continuity has advantageous to model ranking when little training data is used, which is often the case in reality."

The MNIST-1-7 image dataset (LeCun et al., 1998) requires each input feature to lie within the interval [0, 1] (representing normalized pixels).. It is easily linearly separable: an SVM achieves 0.7% error on the clean data.. The Dogfish image dataset (Koh and Liang, 2017) has no input constraints;. paper we allow to take any value in Rd. Compared to the MNIST-1-7 dataset (where n (cid:29) d), the Dogfish dataset has n ≈ d, allowing attackers to potentially exploit overfitting. The Dogfish dataset also has a low base error of 1.3%.. The Enron spam classification text dataset (Metsis et al., 2006) requires input to be non-negative and integer valued,. As with the Dogfish dataset, the Enron dataset has n ≈ d and a relatively low base error of 3.0%.. The IMDB sentiment classification text dataset (Maas et al., 2011) similarly requires input to be non-negative and integer valued. Compared to the other datasets, the IMDB dataset has significantly larger n and d, presenting computational challenges. It also has n (cid:28) d and is not as linearly separable as the other datasets, with a high base error of 11.9%."

Second, TWAFL outperforms FedAVG when the active client fraction is. = 0.1, as indicated in the results in rows one and two in the table. Third, FedAVG is slightly better when the total number of clients is smaller and. is higher, as shown by the results listed in the last row of the table. This implies that the advantage of the proposed algorithm over the traditional federated learning will become more apparent as the number of clients increases. This is encouraging since in most realworld problems, the number of clients is typically very large."

The temporally weighted aggregation strategy accelerates the convergence of the learning and improved the learning performance. • TWAFL performs slightly better than TEFL on MNIST in terms of the total communication cost, while TEFL works better than TWAFL on the HAR datasets. The asynchronous model update strategy significantly contributes to reducing the communication cost per round. • AFL performs the worst among the four compared algorithms. When comparing the performance of the AFL only adopting the asynchronous strategy and the TWAFL using both of them, the asynchronous one always needs the help of the other strategy."

Consequently, noisy training images were generated by adding i.i.d. Gaussian noise on the top of the imperfect ground truth dataset.. Table 2 shows the performance of denoising methods trained for a fixed noise given a noisy groundtruth images with σgt = {1, 5, 10, 20}. The higher the σgt is, the more correlated noise is in a training set. We notice that at low level of ground-truth noise (σgt = 1), both Noise2Noise (DnCNN-N2N) and eSURE (DnCNN-eSURE) yield the best PSNR results and even comparable to the DnCNNMSE. However, as noise correlation gets severe (σgt = 5, 10), Noise2Noise fails to achieve high performance that is consistent with our theoretical derivation. In contrast, the proposed DnCNN. eSURE produces the best quantitative results in a stable manner.

As the original training and test sets are closer to a uniform sample taken from the whole dataset, their distributions are similar. Once we view this from a temporal perspective, that is, unseen data is comprised of future ratings, it is evident that such a change in the distribution severely affects GCMC. This highlights the importance of taking into account the evolution of user-item relationships happening over time.. With this in mind, we see that the recurrent models attain better results than the baseline only in one of the representations. While both LSTM and GRU variants displayed very similar performance, the disjoint edge representation performs worse than its alternative.. As the recurrent models have the exact same configuration in both scenarios, the representation is clearly the main factor influencing the performance of the model. When using all edges from previous steps at every step, the performance gap is evident."

Moreover, GFAttack performs quite well on 2 layers GCN with nonlinear activation. This implies the generalization ability of our attacker on Graph Convolutional Networks.. Table 1 also summaries the attack results of different attackers on sampling-based graph embedding models. As expected, our attacker achieves the best performance nearly on all target. models. It validates the effectiveness of our method on attacking sampling-based models.. Another interesting observation is that the attack performance on LINE is much better than that on DeepWalk. This result may due to the deterministic structure of LINE, while the random sampling procedure in DeepWalk may help raise the resistance to adversarial attack. Moreover, GF-Attack on all graph filters successfully drop the classification accuracy on both Graph Convolutional Networks and sampling-based models, which again indicates the transferability of our general model in practice."

Each dataset was recorded over about a mile of stop-and-go traffic and ranged in time from 2 to 6 minutes. All road segments had between 3 and 6 lanes, corresponding to between 5 and 11 states. In these experiments no metric location information, such as GPS, was used, and topological ground truth was provided. Because of the intermittent nature of the lane line and vehicle detections, not all timesteps possess enough observations to disambiguate lane-states. Thus, in the results presented in Table. we do not consider instances in which either no observations were recorded or the observations voted for at least half of all states, such as seeing only a single lane line immediately to the left of the vehicle. These instances are labeled \"Missing Observations\". Given sequences of timesteps with little or no observations, it is possible to have multiple states tie for the same belief. Localization is considered correct if the true state is among those with maximum belief, and incorrect otherwise. Length and observation quality are shown so as to give an idea about the difficulty of the dataset. Predictions are made at 100Hz."

To simulate false positive data, lane line and vehicle detections are generated according to the topology given by the map with probability PM , and according to some other, randomly selected topology with probability (1 − PM ). Further, to simulate the intermittent nature of real-world data, with probability (1 − PE) no observations are emitted. To see how our approach handles increased sensor noise, we tested different levels of variance. Given a variance σ based on real-world data, simulated observations are generated with variance Kσσ, where Kσ is an experimental parameter. Locations of lane lines and vehicle detections are sampled from multivariate normal distributions with means as a function of the given topology, and variances Kσσ. The observation generation process runs independently for each lane line and vehicle detection. Table II displays the results of local topological structure estimation."

    "reasoning": "The table shows that the setup phase for medium-sized SPNs requires minutes and gigabytes, while the online phase takes seconds and megabytes, with the number of sums having a larger effect on runtimes than products or leaves.",
    "description": "Our benchmarks are given in Table 1.. Generally, our results shown in Table 1 demonstrate that we achieve tractable setup and highly efficient online performance for medium-sized SPNs. Specifically, the setup phase requires costs in the order of minutes and gigabytes, while the online phase takes only a few seconds and megabytes.. While no single parameter appears to be decisive for the runtimes, we observe that some parameters are much more significant: 1. The number of sums has a significantly larger effect than products or leaves, which is expected given the log2 and exp2 operations. But, since the absolute amount of sums is still relatively small, the additional input weights do not affect online communication. 2. Though differences in the number of RVs, product nodes, leaves, and edges do influence the runtimes, deviations have to be very large to take an effect. For instance, when examining the SPNs. for accidents, baudio, and msweb, it takes roughly twice the amount of RVs and edges (the SPN for msweb) compared to the others to reach a significant runtime deviation. 3. When looking at the SPNs for nltcs, the first three SPNs have roughly the same density and the runtime seems to scale according to their size. The last two SPNs, however, have a noticeably higher density but comparable size and result in much higher runtimes. Thus, density (especially the amount of edges) is a much more significant parameter than plain network size. Yet, depending on the SPN, the costs of other, less important parameters can outweigh the costs of individual parameters. This is in line with our theoretical analysis in Section 3.2: the circuit's size depends on the number of children (with different costs for sums and products) as well as the number of RVs and leaves. The amount of layers has no direct effect because the round complexity of Yao's GC protocol is independent of the depth. As for the regular SPNs for nips, one can observe that the effects of hiding RV assignments are insignificant compared to the overall performance. Using 64-bit precision roughly doubles the costs of 32-bit precision, which is expected as the sub-circuits are about twice the size ."

In Table 5, female is the most dominant user type in all of the categories as it shows the importance of this campaign among women. Organizations' impact on this campaign is noteworthy in a sense that one of the main factors of sustainability in an online social campaign is the high level of organization engagement to involve more people in the cause. This is also confirmed by the social network analysis in the previous section that in the top 25 users with highest in-degree, 76% of them are of organization type."

Comparing Row 4 against Row 3 where the MR-GCN is employed for contextual graph encoding, we see that graph context is beneficial for the graph node encoding. Row 5 and 6 enhance the decoder with graph flow attention and graph updating respectively. The graph flow attention shows complementarity with the graph content attention via capturing the structure information in the graph, and outperforms Row 4 on two datasets. However, the graph updating mechanism is more effective on MSCOCO dataset where the number of graph nodes are larger than on VisualGenome dataset. Since the graph updating module explicitly records the status of graph nodes, the effectiveness might be more apparent when generating longer sentences for larger graphs. In Row 7, we incorporate all the proposed components which obtains further gains. Finally, we apply beam search on the proposed model and achieves the best performance."

    "description": "discrimination of 8 emotional states. ur work since the comThe online mode is more. efficient here than the offline mode for both signal and feature input. The hybridization allows us to achieve the best result which is 69.95%. In the literature, most of the existing works classify arousal and valence levels. There is only one work which classifies 8 emotional states . Our ESN trained with linear regression followed with the delta rule outperforms the SVM classifier with FD features.. According to Table 6, the ESN is more robust when using. According to Table 6, t signal instead of feature.. Overall, the online mode is better than the offline mode for the classification of the emotional states.. We can conclude that the delta rule is more efficient when the complexity of the architecture is high than the linear regression."

Combining linear regression and delta rule training enhanced the performance from 61.82% to 67.27%. While using ESN with IP, we can rise the accuracy to 76.15% with bandpower features. When inputting signal to ESN with IP, we obtained an accuracy of 41.82% and 49.09% with the offline mode and online mode, respectively. The hybrid mode shows its effectiveness in this case to reach 61.27% as recognition rate. We believe that existing work combining SVM classifier with entropy features achieves the best result up to 81.31%, but we highlight that we proved that feeding ESN with EEG signal directly can achieve better result than bandpower features which is the aim of our work as depicted in Table 7.. sing the feature vector as The only case the synaptic plasticity reaches good accuracy rate with signal is the classification of stress / calm states using Oja's rule."

For spherical conformal parameterization, our method achieves a lower area distortion. For disk conformal parameterization, the two methods achieve similar area distortions. For free-boundary conformal parameterization, the BFF method possesses a lower area distortion.. The final results are recorded in the rightmost column of Table 7. It can be observed that the area distortion is effectively reduced with the aid of M¨obius transformations in many cases, especially for free-boundary conformal parameterizations and spherical conformal parameterizations. The improvement for disk conformal parameterizations is relatively less significant, possibly due to the smaller number of free parameters. To achieve an even lower area distortion may require the composition with some other conformal transformations, which we plan to explore in the future."

The reason the frequency decreases slightly is that the only computation added is a min operation over p values, which is linear with respect to p (O(p)), where p is the number of points forming the convex hull of the disturbance. The comparison of the wall-clock times of both experiments is shown in Table II.. The robust CBF formulation (left) encounters 0 collisions whereas the non-robust CBF formulation (right) periodically encounters collisions as shown in Table II."

    "description": "much attention in numerical ecology. In ecological studies, the binary matrix is called occurrence matrix. Rows usually corresponds to species, the columns, to locations. For example, the binary matrix shown on Table 1 is known as \"Darwin's Finch\" dataset, which comes from Darwin's studies of the finches on the Galapagos islands (an archipelago in the East Pacific). The matrix represents the presence/absence of 13 species of finches in 17 islands. A \"1\" or \"0\" in entry (i, j) indicates the presence or absence of species i at island j. It is clear from Table 1 that some pairs of species tend to occur together (for example, species 9 and 10) while some other pairs tend to be disjoint. Therefore, it is of our interest to investigate whether the cooperation/competition influences the distribution of species on islands, or the patterns found are just by chance.. before each successful swap using 'Darwin's Finch' dataset. Assuming the randomly chosen row is mostly filled, such as row 1 in Table 1, the two random chosen entries in this row would most likely be [1, 1] but the row of a 'checkerboard unit' has to be either [1, 0] or [0, 1]. Therefore swapping rarely happens when the chosen row/column is mostly filled (or equivalently, mostly unfilled)."

For large p, the advantage of Rectangle Loop algorithm is reduced, but still very significant. For p = 0.5, the Rectangle Loop still produces 4 times more swaps than the swap algorithm. Noteworthy, the zeros and ones play the symmetric rule in a binary matrix, therefore it is not necessary to generate the random matrix for p > 0.5. We also record the time per swap for both algorithms, as shown in the last column of Table 4. It turns out that the Rectangle Loop algorithm still has a significant advantage than the swap algorithm after the running time issue is taken into account. For p = 0.01, the Rectangle Loop is about 31 times more efficient than the swap algorithm. Even for p = 0.5, Rectangle Loop algorithm is still about 4 times more efficient than the swap algorithm."

To illustrate its performance we choose two typical vector lengths m, namely those corresponding to the Hamming bound7 and the Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound8, and list the exponents γ(cid:48) in the running time of the GV-code version of our algorithm as a function of dmin (in fact δ) in Table 1. Here, we write the running of the algorithm as ˜O(nγ(cid:48) ), where ˜O suppresses any polylogarithmic factor of n. One can see that our algorithm runs in subquadratic time when δ is small, or equivalently when the Hamming distance between the closest pair is small. For instance, when δ = 0.05, and the length m = 1.4013 log n, then the running time is O(n1.3313) if we use GV bound."

Thus, these tests seem to conclude that, at the time of writing, the IOTA DLT is not fully structured to support smart services for transportation systems. On the other hand, the good news is that if we carefully select the full node to issue a transaction, the performances definitely improve. In fact, our third scheme \"Adaptive RTT\" has a low amount of errors, on average around 0.8%. Measured latencies are lower than other approaches. Still, the average latency amounts to 23 seconds, which is far from a real-time update of the DLT.. charts further confirm the better performance obtained by the \"Adaptive RTT\" scheme. These. Results confirm that \"Adaptive RTT\" provides better results. Average latencies are definitely lower than other schemes.. In all cases, average latencies increase with the number of buses.. To better emphasize the outcomes, Table. reports some summarized statistics (shown in the box plots) and the error rates. Actually, the main difference on the performance of the approaches is on the amount of errors. While the average error for \"Adaptive RTT\" is ∼ 1%, for the other two schemes we have errors well above 15%. These error rates are clearly unacceptable, meaning that these approaches are unusable."

    "description": "Zyzzyva ,  uses 3f + 1 nodes to solve consensus in three steps (including client communication), requiring a quorum of 3f +1 responses. The protocol tolerates f faults, so it takes an additional two steps when nodes are faulty. Zyzzyva uses the minimum number of nodes, communication steps, and one-to-one messages to achieve fast consensus. It is cheaper than the aforementioned protocols, but also more complex. Zyzzyva's performance boost is due to speculative execution, active participation of the clients in the agreement process, and tolerating temporary inconsistencies among replicas. EZBFT has the same node and quorum requirements as well as the number of communication steps as Zyzzyva. However, by minimizing the latency of the first communication step and alleviating the specialized role of the primary, EZBFT reduces the request processing latency. Aliph  builds a BFT protocol by composing three different sub-protocols, each handling a specific system factor such as contention, slow links, and byzantine faults. Under zero contention, the sub-protocol Quorum can deliver agreement in two steps with 3f + 1 nodes by allowing clients to send the requests directly to the nodes. However, as contention or link latency increases, or as faults occur, Aliph switches to the subprotocol Chain whose additional steps is equal to the number of nodes in the system, or to the sub-protocol Backup which takes at least three steps.. EZBFT exploits the trade-off between the slow and fast path steps. EZBFT uses three steps compared to Aliph's two steps in the common case, and in return, provides slow path in only two extra communication steps unlike Aliph.. Table II summarizes the comparison of existing work with EZBFT. Note that EZBFT and Zyzzyva have the same bestcase communication steps. However, for EZBFT, the latency for the first-step communication is minuscule (tending towards zero) when compared to Zyzzyva's first-step latency."

    "reasoning": "The spread algorithm and the best worker algorithm have the lowest workflow times, but the spread algorithm has a more consistent performance with a lower standard deviation.",
    "description": "the JiT experiments. The recent worker assignment with an average of about 64.48 seconds requires the longest time, due to the long distance between the nodes, since their offers take longer to reach the client and thus arrive more recently. The standard deviation is also relatively high with more than 10 seconds, indicating long running tasks and differing results. The random worker assignment achieves better results with about 46.35 seconds on average and a deviation of 4.25 seconds, since closer workers are chosen. Always selecting the best available worker leads to significantly lower workflow times, requiring about 37.49 seconds, but with a standard deviation of 9.99 seconds. Finally, using the spread assignment algorithm, the workflow time does not significantly differ from the previous assignment algorithm, using about 37.94 seconds, but has a better standard deviation of 7.11 seconds. If all workers are equally capable, the workflow times using the best worker or the spread algorithm do not differ. This shows clearly that in terms of workflow time, the algorithm using the best workers and our spread approach outperform the other approaches. But since not all workers are equally capable in the different capability tests, tests using the best worker have a broader standard deviation, since the capable workers are further away in the topology. This means that always using the best worker is slightly faster than using the spread algorithm, but is more unpredictable in how long the execution of a workflow will take, since the very best workers will be worn up and worse workers have to be chosen consequently. Therefore, we propose our spread algorithm as the best available solution.. Overall, as previously shown in Table II, the workflow times are nearly as good as always selecting the best worker."

In terms of safety, the agent completes 73% of the trials without a crash in these dense environments.. On the other hand, there are some trials such as the third one in Env. 4 in which the agent cannot reach the goal position but does not take decisions which might yield a crash either.. In the last three environments, the agent yields better performance as compared to the former group. It successfully reaches the goal position in 87% of the trials. The other 13% stands for two trials in Env. 8. The  agent yields fairly safe flights with collision-free flight percentage of 86% over the trials in AirSim.. It reaches the goal point successfully during 88% of these safe flights in AirSim"

    "description": "Table IV summarizes the impact of IMDfence on an IMD in terms of energy, performance and program-memory footprint. For the hardware implementation of IMDfence it can be observed that, although the energy requirements increase by more than 6 times for a basic session, the total daily IMD consumption (that includes a two-minute communication session and electrical-stimulation costs) increases from 16.60 J to just 17.37 J, which amounts to a mere 4.64% increase, as previously shown in Fig. 12. The reason for this small increase is that the basic medical functionality, e.g., the continuous electrical stimulation of a pacemaker, dominates the security provisions since the reader accesses are far less frequent. In the case of software (AES-128) implementation of IMDfence, the total daily IMD consumption increases by 13.01% (as shown in Fig. 12). Moreover, there is a minimal increase in the computational delay and required program-memory size. In the context of current MCU technology, 6–7 kB of additional footprint is negligible. Hence, we conclude that there is no noticeable change in the IMD costs when IMDfence is employed."

We provide a fake-news tag for sources on the list.. The site provides a list of sources with 1-3 tags per source (See Table 1).. We were able to find a factual reporting label, which is derived from the previously mentioned scores. Many sources also had descriptive labels, some of which were related to reliability and some of which were related to bias. All these labels are described in Table 1.. We include their bias label and feedback numbers (votes agreeing and votes disagreeing) for each source. The feedback number are not shown in the paper, but can be found in the dataset.. They publish an associated dataset with news sources and their political leaning (left and right), which we include.. We have counted the types of statements coming from each source, which could be used to indicate their truthfulness.. We include the position of the sources in this rating in the dataset based on our access to Alexa on 13th of January 2019."

Both walk/stop and cycle/stop have been penalized with a fine of 15, which is assumed to be a certain punishment and it is common knowledge: then yield/stop (15) and yield/go (18) are the right solutions according to the new street regulations. For the AV, the worst outcomes are to hit the pedestrian (−400) or the cyclist (−200). If they both yield (4), they need to renegotiate the solution. Then walk/stop and cycle/stop (5) are the next worst outcomes because the AV had the right to pass. The best outcome is achieved when they play yield/go (10).. The resulting game in normal form is represented by Table I. The unique NE of the game is yield/go since it is immediate to. see that no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy, therefore in a fully autonomous environment the cyclists will yield and the AVs will go, thus validating the effectiveness of the changes."

Model 1 tests the effect of (un)favorable outcome to an individual, model 2 tests the effect of (un)biased treatment to a group, and model 3 includes both variables. All models include a control variable of self-expectation to control for the participants' own expectations of whether they would pass or fail. Model 1 predicts that participants who were told that they failed the Master qualification test will rate the fairness of the algorithm 1.040 (95% CI: [0.819, 1.260]) point lower on a. Model 2 predicts that participants will rate the biased algorithm 0.410 (95% CI: [0.175, 0.644]) points lower on a 7-point scale (p<0.01), compared with the unbiased algorithm. Therefore, both H1a and H1b are supported. The effect of an unfavorable algorithm outcome is stronger than the effect of a biased algorithm. We compared the adjusted R2 for models 1 and 2, finding that algorithm outcome explains more variance of the perceived fairness than whether the algorithm is biased or not (model 1 adjusted R2=0.161, model 2 adjusted R2=0.055). Model 3 compares the effect more explicitly. The effect size of (un)favorable outcome on perceived fairness (Coef.=-1.034, p<0.001, 95% CI: [-1.253 -0.816]) is twice as much as the effect size of (un)biased algorithm (Coef.=-0.396, p<0.001, 95% CI: [-0.615 -0.177]), which supports H1c."

    "description": "Table 5 describes a regression model predicting perceived fairness from individual differences (e.g., education level, computer literacy, and demographics). Model 1 describes main effects, while Model 2 explores the interaction effects between these variables and algorithm outcomes. Model 1 in Table 5 shows that computer literacy is positively correlated with perceived fairness. On average, participants with low computer literacy report significantly lower perceived fairness than participants with high computer literacy (Coef.=0.285, p<0.05, 95% CI: [-0.515, -0.055]), which supports hypothesis 3b. . Model 2 in Table 5 shows that certain groups react more strongly to an unfavorable outcome. For example, on average, female participants react more strongly to an unfavorable outcome than male participants (Coef.=0.558, p<0.05, 95% CI: [ 0.082, 1.034]) and participants with a lower education level react more strongly to an unfavorable outcome than participants with a higher education level (Coef.=-1.144, p<0.01, 95% CI: [-1.916, -0.372]).

According to given example, P1's and P2's ranking order are {A, C, B} and {C, A, B} respectively. As a result, A and. are considered as a contradicting pair; they satisfy (1) since P1(A) > P1(C) and P2(A) < P2(C).. Two things should be considered while selecting contradicting pairs. First, plagiarized codes in each contradicting pair should be explicitly different to each other when perceived by human. Hence, it is preferable to select pairs that generate high delta similarity degree between evaluated approaches. Second, the difference between evaluated approaches should not be coincidental on selected contradicting pairs. Hence, it is important to assure that similarity degrees resulted from both approaches are significantly different to each other; wherein the significance can be measured using t-test."

    "description": "In case the respondent has to search in applications or on the internet about a particular local pharmacy (Table 6), 27.3% consider that they only search results less or equal than 5km away, 8.1% search results for more than 5km, 31.3% search all results near them, 27.3% search for 3 or fewer results, and 6.1% search more than 3 results near them.. Considering the scenario of the respondent going to a local pharmacy and, after arriving there, verifying that the same does not have all of their medicines available: 1. 59.0% search or inquire about nearby pharmacies to complete their prescription, 2. 32% give up on going to a new pharmacy and order the necessary drugs, getting on the waiting list, 3. 20% call other nearby pharmacies to see if they have the necessary drugs, 4. 16.0% try asking someone for advice on the subject or more information.. only 1.0% have no interest in a new system of contact with pharmacies, 2. 6.0% have low interest, 3. 39% have some interest in the proposed system, 4. moreover, 54% of them have high interest. After the descriptive analysis of the sample, it is essential to perceive the influence of some factors in the opinion of the respondents. Thus, a cross-tabulation analysis of the information was performed using the chi-square test, whose null hypothesis is that the variables are independent. Additionally, the chi-square test provides two statistics that indicate whether the variables are associated or independent: a chi-square statistic and a p-value. Thus, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05 (level of significance considered as acceptable), the null hypothesis is rejected, and the variables are associated. If the p-value is more significant than 0.05, the null hypothesis is not rejected, and it is possible to conclude that variables are independent."

Additionally, people who had already a waste of time to find the necessary drugs have more interest in a new system. If they do not waste time to find drugs, they have less interest in a new system.. Regarding the situation \"sometimes the open pharmacy does not have the needed drugs\" vs. \"interest in a new system,\" the null hypothesis is rejected and, then, both variables are associated. Similar to previous analysis, people who consider that sometimes the open pharmacy does not have the needed drugs have a high interest in a new system..

    "description": "To evaluate the performance, we compare our proposed method with the state-of-the-art folding-free global conformal mapping (FFGCM) algorithm  and the FLASH algorithm  (see Table 3). The MATLAB version of FFGCM is kindly provided by its authors, and the MATLAB version of FLASH can be found at . Because of the \"divide-and-conquer\" nature of our method, our method is capable of producing spherical conformal parameterizations with a smaller angular distortion when compared to the two state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, the FLASH algorithm involves puncturing a triangle from the input surface and flattening the punctured surface onto a big triangular domain. This step unavoidably creates squeezed regions and produces certain angular distortions. While the distortions are alleviated in the subsequent step using quasiconformal composition, the step again involves a domain where most vertices are squeezed at the interior, which leads to some distortions. By contrast, our proposed PGCP method flattens each submesh naturally, with the shape of the submesh boundary taken into consideration. This effectively reduces the angular distortions, thereby producing a spherical conformal parameterization with a better accuracy. Moreover, because of the ability of exploiting parallelism, our method achieves a significant reduction in computational time by over 90% on average when compared to FFGCM. When compared to FLASH, our method achieves comparable efficiency for moderate meshes and a notable reduction in computational time by around 25% for dense meshes. This shows the advantages of our method for spherical conformal parameterization."

For free-boundary and disk. conformal parameterization, it can be observed that our method achieves at least comparable and sometimes better conformality, with a shorter computational time. For spherical conformal. parameterization, our method is advantageous in both the conformality and efficiency. A possible reason is that BFF handles genus-0 closed surfaces by removing an arbitrary vertex star, flattening the punctured surface onto a disk conformally followed by a suitable rescaling, and finally mapping the disk onto the sphere using stereographic projection and filling the punctured vertex star at the pole. The choice of the vertex star greatly affects the overall shape of the disk parameterization of the punctured surface and the final angular distortion of the spherical parameterization. By contrast, our \"divide and conquer\" approach enables us to tackle the conformal flattening problem of subdomains which are obtained from a more natural partition of the surface, thereby achieving better conformality."

    "description": "Table 2 shows the results of several systems on both datasets.7 The column '% perf' indicates the proportion of perfectly segmented super-tokens, while the next three columns indicate precision, recall and F-score for boundary detection, not including the trivial final position characters. The first baseline strategy of not segmenting anything is given in the first row, and unsurprisingly gets many cases right, but performs badly overall. A more intelligent baseline is provided by UDPipe (Straka et al. 2016; retrained on the SPMRL data), which, for super-tokens in morphologically rich languages such as Hebrew, implements a 'most common segmentation' baseline. (i.e. each super-token is given its most common segmentation from training data, forgoing segmentation for OOV items).8 Results for yap represent pure segmentation performance from the previous state of the art (More and Tsarfaty, 2016). The best two approaches in the present paper are represented next: the Extra Trees Random Forest variant,9 called RFTokenizer, is labeled RF and the DNN-based system is labeled DNN. Surprisingly, while the DNN is a close runner up, the best performance is achieved by the RFTokenizer, de. spite not having access to word embeddings. Its high performance on the SPMRL dataset makes it difficult to converge to a better solution using the DNN, though it is conceivable that substantially more data, a better feature representation and/or more hyperparameter tuning could equal or surpass the RFTokenizer's performance. Coupled with a lower cost in system resources and external dependencies, and the ability to forgo large model files to store word embeddings, we consider the RFTokenizer solution to be better given the current training data size. Performance on the out of domain dataset is encouragingly nearly as good as on SPMRL, suggesting our features are robust. This is especially clear compared to UDPipe and yap, which degrade more substantially. A key advantage of the present approach is its comparatively high precision. While other approaches have good recall, and yap approaches RFTokenizer on recall for SPMRL, RFTokenizer's reduction in spurious segmentations boosts its F-score substantially. To see why, we examine some errors in the next section, and perform feature ablations in the following one."

Performance is high even in ablation scenarios, though we keep in mind that baselines for the task are high (e.g. 'most frequent lookup', the UDPipe strategy, achieves close to 90%). The results show the centrality of the lexicon: removing lexicon lookup features degrades performance by about 3.5% perfect accuracy, or 5.5 F-score points. All other ablations impact performance by less than 1% or 1.5 F-score points. Expanding the lexicon using Wikipedia data offers a contribution of 0.3–0.4 points, confirming the original lexicon's incompleteness.10 Looking more closely at the other features, it is surprising that identity of the letters is not crucial, as long as we have access to dictionary lookup using the letters. Nevertheless, removing letter identity impacts especially boundary recall, perhaps. does not break down drastically. The impact on Wiki5k is stronger, possibly because the necessary memorization of familiar contexts is less effective out of domain.. because some letters receive identical lookup values (e.g. single letter prepositions such as b 'in', l 'to') but have different segmentation likelihoods. The 'vowel' features, though ostensibly redundant with letter identity, help a little, causing 0.33 SPMRL F-score point degradation if removed. A"

The HFA auto-annotation mode shows the benefit, especially in a realistic enterprise setting, when we need to annotate 33% of the data to increase F-Score by only 10% (when comparing the on average performance of HFA with ESA) is unreasonable. Table 3 appears to show FA being inferior to EAL in terms of the percentage cut for the Location class, for example. In reality FA reduced sentence annotation by 65% to reach 0.99 F-Score. But as our testing criteria demanded that we either reach 1.0 F-Score or finish all sentences from the pool, FA tried to finish the pool without any further performance improvement on the 0.99 F-Score."

The MT baseline simply consists of the accuracy of the mt sentences with respect to the pe ground truth. The other baseline is given by a statistical PE (SPE) system (Simard et al., 2007) chosen by the WMT17 organizers. Table 2 shows that when our model is trained with only the 11K WMT17 official training sentences, it cannot even approach the baselines. Even when the 12K WMT16 sentences are added, its accuracy is still well below that of the baselines. However, when the 500K artificial data are added, it reports a major improvement and it outperforms them both significantly. In addition, we have compared our model with two recent systems that have used our. same training settings (500K artificial triplets + 23K manual triplets oversampled 10 times), reporting a slightly higher accuracy than both (1.43 TER and 1.93 BLEU p.p. over (Varis and Bojar, 2017) and 0.21 TER and 0.30 BLEU p.p. over (B´erard et al., 2017)). Since their models explicitly predicts edit operations rather than post-edited sentences, we speculate that these two tasks are of comparable intrinsic complexity."

We compare the performance of the three proposed conditioning methods with the two baselines and the state-of-the-art in Table 3.. The results show that incorporating external knowledge in RNN-based architectures consistently improves performance over the baseline for all datasets. Furthermore, feature-based gating improves upon baseline concatenation in the embedding layer across benchmarks, with the exception of PsychExp dataset.. For the Sent17 dataset we achieve state-ofthe-art F1 score using the feature-based gating method; we further improve performance when combining gating with the emb. conc. method. For SST-5, we observe a significant performance boost with combined attentional gating and embedding conditioning (gate + emb. conc.). For PsychExp, we marginally outperform the state-ofthe-art also with the combined method, while for Irony18, feature-based gating yields the best results. Finally, concatenation based conditioning is the top method for SCv1, and the combination method for SCv2."

When evaluated on AIDA-B, their scores are still lower than ours, though significantly higher that those of the previous systems suggesting that web links are indeed valuable.. Second, we compare to fully-supervised systems, which were estimated on AIDA-CoNLL documents.. We distinguish results on a test set taken from AIDA-CoNLL (AIDA-B) and the other standard test sets not directly corresponding to the AIDA-CoNLL domain. When tested on the latter, our approach is very effective, on average outperforming fully-supervised techniques.. As expected, on the in-domain test set (AIDA-B), the majority of recent fully-supervised methods are more accurate than our model.

It appears surprisingly strong, however, we still outperform it by 1.6% (see Table 3).. When we use only global coherence (i.e. only second term in expression (1)) and drop any modeling of local context on the disambiguation stage, the performance drops very substantially (to 82.4% F1, see Table 3).. Without using local scores the disambiguation model appears to be even less accurate than our 'no-statisticaldisambiguation' baseline. It is also important to have an accurate global model: not using global attention results in a 1.2% drop in performance."

Among pretraining tasks, language modeling performs best, followed by MNLI. The remaining pretraining tasks yield performance near that of the random baseline. Even our single-task baseline gets less than a one point gain over this simple baseline. The multitask models are tied or outperformed by models trained on one of their constituent tasks, suggesting that our approach to multitask learning does not reliably produce models that productively combine the knowledge taught by each task.

    "description": "Tables 2 and 3 respectively show results for our pretraining and intermediate training experiments.. Looking to Table 3, using ELMo uniformly improves over training the encoder from scratch. The ELMo-augmented random baseline is strong, lagging behind the single-task baseline by less than a point. Most intermediate tasks beat the random baseline, but several fail to significantly outperform the single-task baseline. MNLI and English–German translation perform best with ELMo, with SkipThought and DisSent also beating the single-task baseline. Intermediate multitask training on all the non-GLUE tasks produces our best-performing ELMo model. Using BERT consistently outperforms ELMo and pretraining from scratch. We find that intermediate training on each of MNLI, QQP, and STS leads to improvements over no intermediate training, while intermediate training on the other tasks harms transfer performance. The improve. ments gained via STS, a small-data task, versus the negative impact of fairly large-data tasks (e.g. QNLI), suggests that the benefit of intermediate training is not solely due to additional training, but that the signal provided by the intermediate task complements the original language modeling objective. Intermediate training on generation tasks such as MT and SkipThought significantly impairs BERT's transfer ability. We speculate that this degradation may be due to catastrophic forgetting in fine-tuning for a task substantially different from the tasks BERT was originally trained on. This phenomenon might be mitigated in our ELMo models via the frozen encoder and skip connection. On the test set, we lag slightly behind the BERT base results from Devlin et al. (2019), likely due in part to our limited hyperparameter tuning."

The correlations reflect the degree to which the performance on one target task with some encoder predicts performance on another target task with the same encoder. See Appendix D for the full table and similar tables for intermediate ELMo and BERT experiments. Many correlations are low, suggesting that different tasks benefit from different forms of pretraining to a substantial degree, and bolstering the observation that no single pretraining task yields good performance on all target tasks. For reasons noted earlier, the models that tended to perform best overall also tended to overfit the WNLI training set most, leading to a negative correlation between WNLI and overall GLUE score. STS also shows a negative correlation, likely due to the observation that it does not benefit from LM pretraining. In contrast, CoLA shows a strong correlation with the overall GLUE scores, but has weak or negative correlations with many tasks: The use of LM pretraining dramatically improves CoLA performance, but most other forms of pretraining have little effect."

    "description": "The experimental results are shown in Table 1, with Int denoting internal comparisons (with three groups) and Ext denoting external comparisons, the highest LAS in each group is marked in bold face.. In the first group, we compare the LAS of the four single models WORD, W2V, LSTM, and CNN. In macro average of all languages, the CNN model performs 2.17% higher than the WORD model, and 1.24% higher than the W2V model. The LSTM model, however, performs only 0.9% higher than the WORD model and 1.27% lower than the CNN model.. In the second group, we observe that the additional word-lookup model does not significantly improve the CNN moodel (from 82.75% in CNN to 82.90% in CNN+WORD on average) while the LSTM model is improved by a much larger margin (from 81.48% in LSTM to 82.56% in LSTM+WORD on average). This suggests that the CNN model has already learned the most important information from the the word forms, while the LSTM model has not. Also, the combined CNN+WORD model is still better than the LSTM+WORD model, despite the large improvement in the latter.. While comparing to the best published results (Björkelund et al., 2013, 2014), we have to note that their approach uses explicit morphological features, ensemble, ranking, etc., which all can boost parsing performance. We only use a greedy parser with much fewer features, but bridge the 6 points gap between the previous best greedy parser and the best published result by more than one half.. On average, the B15-LSTM model improves their own baseline by 1.1%, similar to the 0.9% improvement of our LSTM model, which is much smaller than the 2.17% improvement of the CNN model. Furthermore, the CNN model is improved from a strong baseline: our WORD model performs already 2.22% higher than the B15-WORD model.. Comparing the individual performances on each language, we observe that the CNN model almost always outperforms the WORD model except for Hebrew. However, both LSTM and B15-LSTM perform higher than baseline only on the three agglutinative languages (Basque, Hungarian, and Korean), and lower than baseline on the other six."

    "description": "The entity linking accuracy on the Wikipedia test set are summarized in Table 1. On average, our proposed PBEL method performs significantly better than the baselines, with significant accuracy gains in all nine test languages.. The EXACT baseline, which is most often used for monolingual EL (Sil et al. 2017), performs reasonably only when the test language is in the same script as English (i.e., Javanese).. Similarly TRANS, the current state-of-the-art retrieval method in cross-lingual EL (Pan et al. 2017), fails when zero data is available in the test language, unless the HRL is very closely-related to the LRL (as with jv, mr and am). On the other hand, ENCODE presents relatively strong zero-shot transfer results.. PBEL offers stronger performance than ENCODE. As seen in the BEST-53 results, the HRL that performs best is closely-related to the respective test LRL. We also observe that using multiple pivot HRLs leads to better average accuracy, with considerable improvement for some languages.. In most cases, the MANUAL HRL is also the best performing in BEST-53. However, we see that the Dravidian Telugu (te) seems to obtain higher accuracy with Indo-Aryan HRLs – Punjabi (pa) or Hindi (hi).. We also see that the Ukrainian (uk) test set has better performance with another Cyrillic script language, Kazakh (kk), rather than Russian (ru)."

The second pair of lines present the results of our model, with W2V and FastText embeddings used as the baseline.. We can see that our model is close to the Deep SemanticVisual Embedding (DSVE) method  while the W2V method is slightly worst, as the representation power of the word embedding is reduced.. The BIVEC English-French method is used in English and on both languages simultaneously. If trained only on English, i.e. only on the COCO dataset like the two previous methods, it shows performance similar to the one of the state-of-the-art. This means training using BIVEC does not weaken the English representation. When trained on English and French together, the recall is increased by 3.35 %, going from 65.58 % to 67.78 %. We can also see an improvement for recall@5 and recall@10, with respectively 1.17 % and 0.85 % of increase. This implies that the similarity learning with French captions increases English recognition when using BIVEC.. First of all, when training with MUSE for English only, we can see a sharp decrease in performance, with a recall going from 66.08 % to 63.10 %. By comparing the model trained with W2V, we obtain similar results. This could come from the fact that both MUSE and W2V embeddings do not have representation for out of vocabulary words like the FastText ones. Moreover, rare words have much more chance to be wrongly projected because of space transformation. When we train the model with additional languages, we can see a slight decrease in performance in English. The maximum decrease is 1.01 % for recall@10, but it is counterbalanced by an increase of 0.29 % for the recall@1.. We evaluated our method on the COCO dataset for English-only results and shown that using BIVEC embeddings enables the use of another language in order to improve the performance. The obtained improvement is a 3.35 % increase in performance on the COCO dataset, and a 15.15 % increase on the Multi30K dataset."

    "description": "Table 3 shows the results of fine-tuning the BERT-base model on five text classification datasets and two NLI datasets. For ensemble BERT, both the voted BERT (BERTVOTE) and averaged BERT (BERTAVG) outperform the single BERT (BERTBASE). The average improvement of BERTVOTE is 5.44% (for text clas. sification) and 5.50% (for NLI), while BERTAVG follows closely with 4.07% and 3.24%. BERTVOTE outperforms BERTAVG on all tasks, which adheres to our intuition since BERTVOTE is more complicated. The self-ensemble BERT (BERTSE) has a slight improvement in classification tasks of 2.50%, but it does not work on NLI tasks. This is also a reason why we need self-distillation to improve the base models. Overall, self-distillation model has significant improvement on both classification and NLI tasks. Table 3 shows that BERTSDA and BERTSDV outperform BERTBASE on all datasets. Generally speaking, BERTSDA performs better than BERTSDV on text classification tasks with the improvement of 6.26% vs. 5.65%, but the latter performs better on NLI tasks (BERTSDA vs. BERTSDV is 4.65% vs. 5.30%). Our proposed fine-tuning strategies also outperform the previous method in [Sun et al., 2019] on text classification tasks, which makes extensive efforts to find sophisticated hyperparameters."

Using a pre-trained model improves the performance as well.. Reranking with a threshold rule may be helpful for the overall architecture. We observe that reranking by the critic at all times may not be the best approach. We note that choosing not to rerank when all scores are below 0.5 increases the performance further. On the other hand, reranking if the difference between the best score and second best score is above the threshold we set does not help in this case..

    "description": "The datasets and vision-language task models are described in the appendix, but are referenced in Table 1.. Unsurprisingly, when comparing the first lines of Table 1(a,b), we find that using Word2Vec rather than an embedding trained from scratch tends to improve performance. This is more important when considering a larger vocabulary as seen comparing phrase grounding experiments on DiDeMo and ReferIt, whose embeddings trained from scratch using their smaller vocabulary compare favorably to Word2Vec.. Word2Vec only falls behind within a point or two across all tasks, and even outperforms or performs equally as well as FastText for certain tasks (e.g. text-to-clip, image captioning).. Table 1 also contains a comparison of language model variants across the five vision-language tasks we evaluate on. We see that fine-tuning a word embedding on a visionlanguage task can have dramatic effects on the performance of the language model (e.g. 5-10% increase to mean recall on image-sentence retrieval).. When comparing the architecture choices from Figure 3 we see that for retrieval-based tasks (i.e. where the output is not free-form text) the Average Embedding and SelfAttention models perform better than a simple LSTM-based approach, with Self-Attention being best on average.. The only apparent exception to this is the text-to-clip task.. InferSent and BERT reach comparable values to the best Word2Vec models for image-sentence retrieval on Flickr30K, performing more poorly for the MSCOCO dataset. For the remaining retrieval tasks, metrics are below the best performing model and embedding combination within 1-3 points, again noting the unusual exception of InferSent on phrase grounding of Flickr30K Entities, which significantly drops below scratch performance.. While all language models perform closely on ReferIt phrase grounding, this still suggests that there is no need to use the more complex LSTM language model without additional modification.. Lastly, sentence level embeddings InferSent and BERT are compared in Table 1(d); results are without fine-tuning.. The two are comparable to each other with the exception of phrase grounding accuracy on Flickr30K Entities; BERT surprisingly outperforms InferSent by 11.55%. Both InferSent and BERT do not provide the best results across any task, and thus are not a leading option for vision-language tasks."

These changes result in an embedding with comparable performance to the HGLMM 6K-D features, which are reported in Table 2(e). However, our word embedding tends to perform better when embeddings are the same size (i.e. 300-D). For the generation-based tasks (i.e. captioning and VQA), the benefits of using adapted embeddings are less clear. This may simply be an artifact of the challenges in evaluating these tasks (i.e., the captions are improving in a way the metrics don't capture).. Visual Word2Vec performs comparably amongst results for generation tasks (i.e. image captioning and VQA), but these tasks have little variance in results, with less than a point of difference across the adapted embeddings.. The small gain provided in generation tasks by Visual Word2Vec does not out-weight the drops in performance across other tasks such as the significant mean recall drop of 6.3 compared to HGLMM's 6K-D Self-Attention result in line two of Table 2(c) and Table 2(e) for image-sentence retrieval of Flickr30K. For comparison, GrOVLE's Self-Attention result in Table 2(b) is only 3 points lower.. Finally, we report results using HGLMM of different dimension. HGLMM 300-D features are used for a more fair comparison to other embeddings. While the HGLMM 6K-D representation primarily results in the highest performance, it performs more poorly on generation tasks and also results in high variance. For example, column one in Table 2(e) shows a range of 7.1 in mean recall, unlike GrOVLE which has a range of 2.6."

To verify that the multi-task GrOVLE performance improvements generalize across task model architecture, we provide results using additional task models in Table 4..

The first lines of Table 3 report the results of the original fixed GrOVLE embedding, which should be considered the baseline. The second line of Table 3 reports performance when the four-task pretrained GrOVLE is fixed when used in the target task, i.e. the task currently being run. The third and fourth line of Table 3 report the results of our embedding when they were trained on all five tasks, and kept fixed or fine-tuned for the target task, respectively.. The results of line three and four demonstrate that our improved embedding tends to transfer better when applied with fine-tuning during the target task. We find similar trends in performance improvements across tasks: larger gains occur for image-sentence retrieval with +7.9 mean recall for the Flickr30K dataset and +6.3 for MSCOCO. All other tasks have performance improvements under one point, showing that while the vision-language tasks appear to transfer well without harming performance, they are leveraged most in image-sentence retrieval, with an exception of phrase grounding accuracy on ReferIt (+2.36%)."

    "description": "We next conduct a series of experiments in which we train on DBiDAF, DBERT, and DRoBERTa, and observe how well models can then learn to generalise on the respective test portions of these datasets. Table 5 shows the results, and there is a multitude of observations.. First, one clear trend we observe across all training data setups is a clear negative performance progression when evaluated against datasets constructed with a stronger model in the loop. This trend holds true for all but the BiDAF model, in each of the training configurations, and for each of the evaluation datasets. For example, RoBERTa trained on DRoBERTa achieves 71.4, 53.5, 48.6 and 38.9 F1 when evaluated on DSQuAD, DBiDAF, DBERT and DRoBERTa, respectively. Second, we observe that the BiDAF model is not able to generalise well to datasets constructed with a model in the loop, independent of its training setup. In particular it is unable to learn from DBiDAF, thus failing to overcome some of its own blind spots through adversarial training. Both when training only on DBiDAF, as well as when adding DSQuAD to DBiDAF during training (cf. Table 6), BiDAF performs poorly across all the adversarial datasets.. results in Table 5, where training on DBiDAF in several cases led to better generalisation than training on DRoBERTa.. we further train each of our three models on either DBiDAF, DBERT, or DRoBERTa and test on DSQuAD, with results in the DSQuAD columns of Table 5.. First, we observe clear generalisation improvements towards DDROP across all models compared to training on DSQuAD(10K) when using any of the DBiDAF, DBERT, or DRoBERTa datasets for training. That is, including a model in the loop for the training dataset leads to improved transfer towards DDROP. Note that the DROP dataset also makes use of a BiDAF model in the loop during annotation; these results are in line with our prior observations when testing the same setups on DBiDAF, DBERT and DRoBERTa, compared to training on DSQuAD(10K). Second, we observe overall strong transfer results towards DNQ: up to 71.0F1 for a BERT model trained on DBiDAF. Note that this result is similar and even slightly improves over model training with SQuAD data of the same size. That is, relative to training on SQuAD data, training on adversarially collected data DBiDAF does not impede generalisation to the DNQ dataset, which was created without a model in the annotation loop. We then however see a similar negative performance progression as observed before when testing on DSQuAD: the stronger the model in the annotation loop of the training dataset, the lower the test accuracy on test data from a data distribution composed without using a model in the loop."

    "description": "We test an unsupervised setting using (1) the algorithm proposed in Section 4.4 with EmbDI local embeddings, and (2) an existing matching system  with both pre-trained embeddings (SeepP ) and our local embeddings (SeepL). Pre-trained embeddings for tokens and tuples have been obtained from Glove .. Table 3 reports the results w.r.t. manually defined attribute matches. The simple unsupervised method with EmbDI local embeddings outperforms the baseline in terms of Fmeasure in all scenarios. Results of RefS are the best because of the high overlap between its datasets. The baseline improves when it is executed with EmbDI local embeddings, showing their superior quality w.r.t. pre-trained ones. The Basic local embeddings lead to 0 attribute matches.. We also observe that results for SeepPreTrain depend on the quality of the original attribute labels. If we replace the original (expressive and correct) labels with synthetic ones, Seep-PreTrain obtains F-measure values between .30 and .38. Local embeddings from EmbDI do not depend on the presence of the attribute labels.. Similarly, decreasing the size of the walks to 5 for the SM task raises the F-measure for RefL to .92 (from .77)."

In Table 6 we show experimental results for the same models and training datasets, but now including SQuAD as additional training data. In this training setup we generally see improved generalisation to DBiDAF, DBERT, and DRoBERTa. Interestingly, the relative differences between DBiDAF, DBERT, and DRoBERTa as training set used in conjunction with SQuAD are now much diminished, and especially DRoBERTa as (part of the) training set now generalises substantially better. RoBERTa achieves the strongest results on any of the DBiDAF, DBERT, and DRoBERTa evaluation sets, in particular when trained on DSQuAD+DRoBERTa.. we identify a risk of datasets constructed with weaker models in the loop becoming outdated. For example, RoBERTa achieves 58.2EM/73.2F1 on DBiDAF, in contrast to 0.0EM/5.5F1 for BiDAF – which is not far from non-expert human performance of 62.6EM/78.5F1.. We furthermore observe a gradual decrease in generalisation to SQuAD when training on DBiDAF towards training on DRoBERTa. This suggests that the stronger the model used in the annotation loop, the more dissimilar the data distribution becomes from the original SQuAD distribution. We will later find further support for this explanation in a qualitative analysis (Section 5). It may however also be due to a limitation of BERT and RoBERTa – similar to BiDAF – in learning from a data distribution designed to beat these models; an even stronger model might learn more e.g. from DRoBERTa."

STSL performs the best among all models on the directness classification, and it is also consistent in both micro and macro-F1 scores.. due to the fact that the directness has only two labels and multilabeling is not allowed in this task. Tasks involving imbalanced data, multiclass and multilabel annotations harm the performance of the directness in multitask settings.. Since macro-F1 is the average of all F1 scores of individual labels, all deep learning models have high macro-F1 scores in English which indicates that they are particularly good at classifying the direct class. STSL is also comparable or better than traditional BOW feature-based classifiers when performed on other tasks in terms of microF1 and for most of the macro-F1 scores. This shows the power of the deep learning approach.. Except for the directness, MTSL usually outperforms STSL or is comparable to it.. MTML settings do not lead to a big improvement which may be due to the class imbalance, multilabel tasks, and the difference in the nature of the tasks."

Zero-shot learning reaches an F1 score of 58% in the MEDIUM setup, which outperforms training the neural tagger on very limited gold data (plain).. Neural NER is better than traditional HMM-based tagging (TnT) (Brants, 2000) and greatly improves by unsupervised word embedding initialization (+Poly). It is noteworthy that zero-shot transfer benefits only to a limiting degree from more source data (F1 increases by almost 3% when training on all English CoNLL data).. To compare cross-lingual transfer to limited gold data (RQ2), we observe that training the neural system on the small amount of data together with Polyglot embeddings is close to the tiny-shot transfer setup.. Few-shot learning greatly improves over zero-shot learning. The most beneficial way is to add the target data to the source, in comparison to fine-tuning.. In both MEDIUM and LARGE setups are further gains obtained by adding TINY or SMALL amounts of Danish gold data.

    "description": "Table 3 compares the performance of the four weighting variants introduced in Section 3.2. TransWeight-feat, which sums the transformed representations and then weights each component of the summed representation, has the weakest performance, with only 50.82% of the test compounds receiving a rank that is lower than 5. A better performance – 52.90% – is obtained by applying the same weighting for each column of the transformations matrix H. The results of TransWeight-trans are interesting in two respects: first, it outperforms the feature variation, TransWeight-feat, despite training a smaller number of parameters (300 vs. 400 in our setup). Second, it performs on par with the TransWeight-mat variation, although the latter has a larger number of parameters (20,200 in our setup). This suggests that an effective combination method needs to take into account full transformations, i.e. entire rows of H and combine them in a systematic way. TransWeight builds on this insight by making each element of the final composed representation p dependent on each component of the transformed representation H. The result is a noteworthy increase in the quality of the predictions, with ∼12% more of the test representations having a rank ≤5. Although this weighting does use significantly more parameters than the previous weightings (4,000,200 parameters), the number of parameters is relative to the number of transformations t and does not grow with the size of the vocabulary. As the results in the next subsection show, a relatively small number of transformations is sufficient even for larger training vocabularies."

    "reasoning": "TransWeight consistently outperforms other models across all languages and phrase types, despite having significantly fewer parameters compared to FullLex+.",
    "description": "The results using the corrected rank eval. TransWeight, the composition model proposed in this paper, delivers consistent results, being the best performing model across all languages and phrase types. The difference in performance to the runner-up model, FullLex+, translates into more of the test phrases being close to the original repachieving a rank ≤ 5. This resentations, i.e. difference ranges from 8% of the test phrases in the German compounds dataset to less than 1% for English adjective-noun phrases. However, it is important to note the substantial difference in the number of parameters used by the two models: all TransWeight models use 100 transformations and have, therefore, a constant number of 12,020,200 parameters. In contrast the number of parameters used by FullLex+ increases with the size of the training vocabulary, reaching 739,320,200 parameters in the case of the English adjective-noun dataset. The most difficult task for all the composition models in any of the three languages is compound composition. We believe this difficulty can be mainly attributed to the complexity introduced by the position. For example in adjective-noun composition, the adjective always takes the first position, and the noun the second. However, in compounds the same noun can occur in both positions throughout different training examples. Consider for example the compounds boat house and house boat. In boat house – a house to store boats – the meaning of house is shifted towards shelter for an inanimate object, whereas house boat selects from house aspects related to human beings and their daily lives happening on the boat. These positionrelated differences can make it more challenging to create composed representations. that makes adverbadjective easier is the high dataset frequency of some of the adverbs/adjectives. For example, in the English and adjective-noun datasets Another aspect the. adjective-noun dataset a small subset of 52 adjectives like new, good, small, public, etc. are extremely frequent, occurring more than 500 times in the training portion of the adjective-noun sample dataset. Because the adjective is always the first element of the composition, the phrases that include these frequent adjectives amount to around 24.8% of the test dataset. Frequent constituents are more likely to be modeled correctly by composition – thus leading to better results.. The additive models (Addition, SAddition, VAddition) are the least competitive models in our evaluation, on all datasets. The results strongly argue for the point that additive models are too limited for composition. An adequate composed representation cannot be obtained simply as an (weighted) average of the input components.. The Matrix model clearly outperforms the additive models. However, its results are modest in comparison to models like WMask+, BiLinear, FullLex+ and TransWeight. This is to be expected: having a single affine transformation limits the model's capacity to adapt to all the possi. ble input vectors u and v. Because of its small number of parameters, the Matrix model can only capture the general trends in the data.. More interaction between u and v is promoted by the BiLinear model through the d bilinear forms in the tensor. ∈ Rn×d×n. This capacity to absorb more information from the training data translates into better results — the BiLinear model outperforms the Matrix model on all datasets.. In evaluating FullLex we tried to mitigate its treatment of unknown words. Instead of using unknown matrices to model composition of phrases not in the training data, we take a nearest neighbor approach to composition. Take for example the phrase sky-blue dress, where sky-blue does not occur in train. Our implementation, FullLex+, looks for the nearest neighbor of sky-blue that appears in train, blue and uses the matrix associated with it for building the composed representation. The same approach is also used for the WMask model, which is referred to as WMask+.. On this dataset WMask+ fares only slightly worse than FullLex+ (0.70%), an indication that FullLex+ suffers from data sparsity in such scenarios and cannot produce good results without an adequate amount of training data. By contrast, the gap between the two models increases considerably on datasets with more phrases per word — e.g. FullLex+ outperforms WMask+ with 8.07% on the English adjective-noun phrase dataset, which has 11.6 phrases per word."

Roughly 30% of the triples (104M) in OPIEC are clean according to the above constraints. Table 2 shows that clean triples are generally shorter on average and tend to have a higher confidence score than the full set of triples in OPIEC.. About 49% of all triples in OPIEC contain some sort of semantic annotation (cf. Tab. 2); in OPIEC-Linked, the fraction increases to 58%. Most of the semantic annotations referred to quantities, space or time; these annotations provide important context for the extractions. There is a significantly smaller amount of negative polarity and possibility modality annotations. One reason for the lack of such annotations may be in the nature of the Wikipedia articles, which aim to contain encyclopedic, factual statements and are thus more rarely negated or hedged."

As can be seen from the tables, PAFIBERT outperformed other models on both the in-domain Das's test set and the out-of-domain YAGS test set, yielding new state-of-the-art results for frame identification. As expected, the results obtained with LU-based frame filtering were slightly better than those produced using target-based frame filtering, suggesting that a realistic setup is crucial in measuring model performance more precisely.. On Das's test set, for example, PAFIBERT achieved absolute improvements of 4-5% and 9% with frame filtering (Table 2) and without frame filtering (Table 3) respectively. As reported by , frame identification models usually suffer a drastic drop in performance when tested on out-of-domain data. The same trend was observed in our experiments for the YAGS test set. Nevertheless, PAFIBERT still outperformed existing methods by a large margin on this out-of-domain test set. Besides, in the more challenging setup that involved no frame filtering, the results obtained by PAFIBERT were on par with the prior state-of-the-art accuracies achieved with frame filtering."

Punctuation and digits hold more importance for the ddi dataset, which is a biomedical dataset, compared to the other two datasets..

Entity blinding causes almost 9% improvement in classification performance and 1% improvement in detection performance.. While entity blinding hurts performance for semeval, possibly due to the coarse-grained nature of the replacement, NER blinding does not hurt performance.. entity blinding seems to help test set performance for ddi in table 4, but shows no statistical significance."

Adding character-bigram and softword representations as described in Section 3.1 increases the F1-score to 67.63% and 65.71%, respectively, demonstrating the usefulness of both sources of information. In addition, a combination of both gives a 69.64% F1-score, which is the best. among various character representations.. Table 4 shows a variety of different settings for word-based Chinese NER. With automatic segmentation, a word-based LSTM CRF baseline gives a 64.12% F1-score, which is higher compared to the character-based baseline. This demonstrates that both word information and character information are useful for Chinese NER. The two methods of. word+char LSTM and word+char LSTM(cid:48), lead to similar improvements.. A CNN representation of character sequences gives a slightly higher F1-score compared to LSTM character representations. On the other hand, further using character bigram information leads to increased F1-score over word+char LSTM, but decreased F1-score over word+char CNN.. As shown in Table 4, the lattice LSTM-CRF model gives a development F1-score of 71.62%, which is significantly7 higher compared with both the word-based and character-based methods, despite that it does not use character bigrams or word segmentation information."

On the other hand, for the Subtitles data, we see a maximum improvement of +0.30 BLEU for InitDec+AddDec.. The next set of experiments evaluates the five different approaches for computing the sourceside context. from Table 2 that for English-Estonian and English-German, our model indeed benefits from using is evident. Finally, our results with source, target and dual contexts are reported. Interestingly, just using the source context is sufficient for English-Estonian and English-German. For English-French, on the other hand, we see significant improvements for the models using the target-side conversation history over using only the source-side.. Unlike Europarl, for Subtitles, we see improvements for our Src-TgtMix dual context variant over the Src-Tgt one for En→Ru,. To summarise, for majority of the cases our Language-Specific Sentence-level Attention is a winner or a close second.

It is clear that all different setups of UTDSM perform better than the baseline for both contextual semantic similarity metrics. Using a single Gaussian distribution (UTDSM + GMM (1)) at the smoothing step of our method produces similar results to the baseline model.. We also observe that random anchoring performs slightly worse than UTDSM with respect to AvgSimC.. Furthermore, we observe that GMM smoothing has a different effect on the MaxSimC and AvgSimC metrics. Specifically, for AvgSimC we consistently report lower results when GMM smoothing is applied for different number of components.. At the same time, our smoothing technique highly improves the performance of MaxSimC for all possible configurations.. Overall, the performance of our model is highly competitive to the state-of-the-art models in terms of AvgSimC, for 500-dimensional topic embeddings. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance for the MaxSimC metric, using smoothed topic embeddings of 300 or 500 dimensions with 2 or 3 Gaussian components."

Yet, average pooling performs worse for the lower pruning threshold, which shows that the model is still affected by noise among the hypotheses.. Weighted pooling performs better for the lower pruning threshold of 0.001 with which we obtain the highest result overall, improving the joint goals accuracy by 1.6 percentage points compared to the baseline.. Moreover, we see that an ensemble model that averages the predictions of ten cnet models trained with different random seeds also outperforms an ensemble of ten baseline models..

Specifically, non-CS human judges fail at more than half of the 1-to-1 sets for the same titles, which suggests that most of our system generated abstracts follow correct grammar and consistent writing style. Domain experts fail on 1 or 2 sets, mostly because the human written abstracts in those sets don't seem very topically relevant. Additionally, the more abstracts that we provided to human judges, the easier it is to conceal the system generated abstract amongst human generated ones."

Compared to the feature concatenation used in EF, the Cartesian product used in TFN results in higher dimensionality of the multimodal input vector,5 which in turn increases the complexity of the model. Similarly, the HF model has worse performance than the EF model here, unlike in Tian et al. (2016).. In general, the multimodal models have better performance than the unimodal models.. In fact, the HF and LF models have better performance using single-task learning.

It achieves around 84% accuracy on test set which outperforms other models significantly.. First, each paragraph is encoded with LSTM. The hidden state at the end of each sentence is extracted, and the resulting matrix is going through gated CNN (Dauphin et al., 2017) for extraction of single encoding for each paragraph. The accuracy is barely above 50%, which depicts that this method is not very promising.. We have used a pre-trained BERT in two different ways. First, as a feature extractor without fine-tuning, and second, by fine-tuning the weights during training.. In the case of fine-tuning, we have used different numbers for maximum sequence length to test the capability of BERT in this task.. we increased the number of tokens and accuracy respectively increases.. We found this method very promising and the accuracy significantly increases with respect to previous methods (Table 3). This result reveals fine-tuning pre-trained BERT can approximately learn the order of the paragraphs and arrow of the time in the stories."

    "description": "Table 2 shows how the position of the context window influences the average model performance. Note that symmetric windows of, for instance, 10 are in fact 2 times larger than the 'left' or 'right'. windows of the same size, as they consider 10 words both to the left and to the right of the focus word. This is most likely why symmetric windows consistently outperform 'single-sided' ones on the analogy task, as they are able to include twice as much contextual input. However, the average performance on the semantic similarity task (as indicated by the Spearman correlation with the SimLex999 test set) does not exhibit the same trend. 'Left' windows are indeed worse than symmetric ones, but 'right' windows are on par with the symmetric windows for OpenSubtitles and only one percent point behind them for Gigaword. It means that in many cases (at least with English texts) taking into account only n context words to the right of the focus word is sufficient to achieve the same performance with SimLex999 as by using a model which additionally considers n words to the left, and thus requires significantly more training time."

However, fine tuning with a model trained using PU learning led to an increase of 1 F1 point over the non-PU learning model, indicating that PU learning enables the Wikipedia data to be useful for transferring to rumour detection. For PUC, we saw an improvement of 0.7 F1 points over the baseline and lower overall variance than vanilla PU learning, meaning that the results with PUC are more consistent across runs. When models are ensembled, pretraining with vanilla PU learning improved over no pretraining by almost 2 F1 points."

All significance tests are measured by paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn, 2004).. Table 1 reports the results on the NIST ChineseEnglish test sets. It is observed that the Transformer models significantly outperform SMT and RNNsearch models. Therefore, we decide to implement all of our experiments based on Transformer architecture. The direct bridging model can further improve the translation quality of the Transformer baseline. The decoder WT model improves the translation quality while reducing the number of parameters for the word representation. This improved performance happens because there are fewer model parameters, which prevents over-fitting (Press and Wolf, 2017). Finally, the performance is further improved by the proposed method while using even fewer parameters than other models."

As shown in Table 4, the decoder WT model can be seen as a kind of shared-private method where zero features are shared between the source and target word embeddings. For the proposed method, λ = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) and λ = (1, 1, 1) are, respectively, used for sharing half and all features between the embeddings of all categories of words. This allows the model to significantly reduce the number of parameters and also improve the translation quality. For comparison purpose, we also consider sharing a large part of the features among the unrelated words by setting s3 to 0.9, i.e. λ = (0.5, 0.7, 0.9). We argue that it is hard for"

    "description": "The results of the evaluation of the models on the test sets are shown in Table 1. We notice that additional training on WIKICREM consistently improves the performance of the models in all scenarios and on most tests. Due to the small size of some test sets, some of the results are subject to deviation. This especially applies to PDP (60 test samples) and WNLI (145 test samples). We observe that BERT WIKIRAND generally performs worse than BERT, with GAP and PDP being notable exceptions. This shows that BERT is a strong baseline and that improved performance of BERT WIKICREM is not a consequence of training on shorter sentences or with different loss function. BERT WIKICREM consistently outperforms both baselines on all tests, showing that WIKICREM can be used as a standalone dataset. We observe that training on the data from the target distribution improves the performance the most. Models trained on GAP-train usually show more than a 20% increase in their F1-score on GAP-test. Still, BERT WIKICREM GAP shows. a consistent improvement over BERT GAP on all subsets of the GAP test set. This confirms that WIKICREM works not just as a standalone dataset, but also as an additional pre-training in the transductive scenario. Similarly, BERT WIKICREM DPR outpertasks, forms BERT DPR on the majority of showing the applicability of WIKICREM to the scenario where additional training data is available. However, good results of BERT GAP DPR show that additional training on a manually constructed dataset, such as GAP, can yield similar results as additional training on WIKICREM. The reason behind this difference is the impact of the data distribution. GAP, DPR, and WIKICREM contain data that follows different distributions which strongly impacts the trained models. This. can be seen when we fine-tune BERT GAP on DPR to obtain BERT GAP DPR, as the model's performance on GAP-test drops by 8.2%. WIKICREM's data distribution strongly differs from the test sets' as described in Section 3. the achieves However, the best results are achieved when all available data is combined, as shown by the models BERT ALL and BERT WIKICREM ALL. BERT WIKICREM ALL highest performance on GAP, DPR, WNLI, and WINOBIAS among the models, and sets the new state-of-the-art result on GAP, DPR, and WINOBIAS. result on the WINOGENDER dataset is achieved by the BERT WIKICREM DPR model, while BERT WIKICREM ALL and BERT GAP DPR set the new state-of-the-art on the PDP dataset.
